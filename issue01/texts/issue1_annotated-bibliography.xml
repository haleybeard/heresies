 <p>Tomie Arai (b. 1949)  is an American artist involved in community art and activism. Her works, which are often site-specific and public, speak upon subjects such as racial identity and gender. In 2015, she founded The Chinatown Art Brigade, a cultural collective dedicated to social justice, with artists Betty Yu and ManSee Kong. <title>Wall of Respect for Women</title> is a community mural that was painted in New York City in 1974. Arai directed a group of women from the Lower East Side in painting this. In this work, a large tree is central to the composition. Interspersed throughout the tree we see a number of female figures engaged in various activities traditionally designated for women, such as sewing, cooking, and teaching. According to Eva Cockcroft, who writes about the <title>Wall of Respect for Women</title> in her essay, “Women in the Community Mural Movement,” this mural “epitomizes the non-antagonistic type of feminism portrayed on non-white community walls dealing with the theme of woman. Rather than condemning more traditional women’s roles, this mural celebrates all the roles played by women.” <title>Wall of Respect for Women</title> does exactly what its title suggests - it acts as a way to respect and thank the often unnoticed and underappreciated labor of community women.</p>

 <p>Dotty Attie (b. 1938) is a feminist painter and one of twenty co-founders of A.I.R. Gallery, the first all-female cooperative art gallery in America. Attie’s art practice is centered around appropriating and reconceptualizing 18th and 19th-century artworks as a means of self-exploration. <title>Pierre and Lady Holland</title> is a series of square panels of graphite drawings and text. There are 140 panels total in the series, which all come together to tell the fictional story of the wealthy Lady Holland and her “acquisition,” Pierre, as stated by Barbara Baracks in “Dotty Attie,” Artforum. Heresies contains 6 of the 140 total panels. Three of the panels are drawings, two of which depict a close-up image of a woman’s face, while the other depicts a close-up of a woman’s hand clutching fabric. The other panels contain statements that read, “This was indeed a singular revelation,” “It conveyed something at which she could hardly have guessed,” and “The result was curious and unexpected.” The context of these statements is unknown, but as they are featured in the section of Heresies, “Now Women Repossess Their Own Sexuality...", we can assume that these six panels, as well as the whole of Pierre and Lady Holland, explore a similar theme.</p> </div>

 <p>Louise Bourgeois (1911-2010) was a French-American feminist artist. While she is best known 
 for her monumental sculptures, she was also a prolific painter and printmaker. <title>Femme Couteau</title>, or Woman Knife, is a 26-inch-long polished marble sculpture. The knife contains distinctly feminine features: the sculpture has the curvature of an exaggerated female form, with curves at the breasts and hips, and a narrowing at the waist. The “head” of the figure tapers, forming the point of the knife. In this sculpture, the woman turns into the blade, emphasizing how feminity can be both seductive and destructive. <title>Femme Couteau</title> explores the interplay between eroticism and violence, and how violence inflicted upon women requires women to fight back in order to reclaim their femininity. In Heresies, <title>Femme Couteau</title> appears in Heresies under the heading, “Now Women Repossess Their Own Sexuality.”</p>

 <p>This essay is comprised of individual statements by the editorial collective of Heresies - Joan Braderman, Harmony Hammond, Elizabeth Hess, Arlene Ladden, Lucy Lippard, and May Stevens -  in which they address and analyze the ways in which their experiences and beliefs shape their individual relationship with feminism and politics. While each member’s response is personal, the collective holds a shared belief in the potential of Heresies. They assert that Heresies presents an opportunity to develop a coherent feminist theory that challenges established and outdated ways of thinking, in order to work towards a feminist culture that is politically, economically, and socially just.</p>

 <p>Joan Braderman (1948 - ) is a video artist, writer, and co-founder of Heresies magazine. In her essay “Juggling Contradictions: Feminism, the Individual, and What's Left”, Braderman uses the concept “the contradiction,” to explain the myths and falsities that dominate and account for the weakest elements of feminist ideology. Braderman explains how feminism has become entrapped in capitalism, ruining the ability for liberation. Radical feminism has tried to address this contradiction, but many radical feminists ultimately re-entered the dominant culture. The same is true for other forms of feminism, like traditional and bourgeois feminism, they all run into “contradictions”. Braderman then discusses the importance of prominent theories like Freud, Marx, and Engels, which despite their sexist tendencies, have identified the patriarchal family as the primary prison for women, which have been utilized in many social revolutions. While liberalism offers a theoretical solution to earlier feminism’s demise, it suffers similar contradictions but is ultimately the best solution. She then applies the feminist practices to the Heresies collective, which attempts to dismantle hierarchical systems, although still has to participate within capitalist society in order to fund the publication.</p>

There is a photograph of this mural included in the essay, “Women in the Community Mural Movement”. The photograph appears to be from a spectator vantage point, and includes a gathering of people, mostly women, in winter coats, staring at the mural. The mural appears to be on a brick building and features multiple people of different races. There is little information about the origins of the murals, their creators, or the photo.</p>

 <p>Karen Carson (b. 1943) has been working as an artist since 1971. Carson began her <title>Beds</title> series in the same year and continued it until 1975, making it some of her earliest work. Three drawings from the series - <title>Edge of Night</title>, <title>Cracking Up</title>, and <title>Shattered Dreams</title> - are featured in Ruth E. Iskin’s Essay, ‘“Female Experience in Art’: The Impact of Women’s Art in a Work Environment.” In these drawings, Carson examines the myth of women's happiness in sexual relationships. As a woman and an artist, Carson was feeling severe frustration over the way she and other women were being treated by men, and as a means to reflect upon these emotions, she created the Beds series. Each drawing in the series depicts a single bed being disfigured or mutilated in some way, to which the artist states that the bed itself represents a woman’s body. In <title>Edge of Night</title>, a large saw blade slices the bed in half, speaking upon the violence and violation inflicted upon women in the bedroom. In <title>Cracking Up</title>, the mattress is splitting into many parts, signifying a woman's disintegration from within. In <title>Shattered Dreams</title>, the bed breaks apart into shards of glass, and by doing so smashes any illusions the viewer might have about the role of women in the bedroom. Carson was inspired by the art-historical tradition of depicting women reclining submissively on beds and sofas, a tradition of which she combats with a macabre sense of humor that is also present in her references to popular puns in the works’ titles.</p>

Her poem “the empress anastasia in new york”, details various wars and revolutions and their impact on people. She starts first naming Anastasia, the empress. The poem can be interpreted as Anatasia’s experience through all wars, hunger, pain, and of desire, of loneliness, all of which impact her dreams.

 <p>Eva Cockcroft (1937-1999) was a muralist and educator. She was known for her socially charged 
 murals, which often depicted themes such as racial unity and labor rights. She wanted to make murals that would create beauty and identity within a community, and often involved community members in the mural-making process. “Women in the Community Mural Movement” is an essay that focuses on the underrepresented role of women in the community mural movement as well as the immense diversity within this movement. According to Cockcroft, women have dominated the mural movement as a symbol of collectivity and anti-elitism, and as a practice for various social philosophies. Despite this, Cockcroft stresses how women muralists are still held to a lesser standard than their male counterparts. Throughout the essay, Cockcroft also highlights a number of women muralists and mural-painting collectives, and while doing so emphasizes the variation in politicization and value systems amongst community muralists. However, despite this variation, Cockcroft ends her essay by asserting that there is a unifying agreement between all muralists that “there is no such thing as Art for art’s sake” - all art, especially community art, holds cultural and political meaning.</p>

 <p>Eva Cockcroft (1937-1999) was a muralist and educator. She was known for her socially charged 
 murals, which often depicted themes such as racial unity and labor rights. She wanted to make murals that would create beauty and identity within a community, and often involved community members in the mural-making process. Warrensburg is a mural that Cockcroft created for <title>Warrensburg</title>, a small conservative town in the Adirondacks. In her essay, “Women in the Community Mural Movement,” Cockcroft speaks about how this commission brought her great stress, as the town’s conservative beliefs went against her values. She faced the problem of how to create a mural that would illustrate the town’s tumultuous history in a way that would not offend residents but would also not violate Cockcroft’s convictions or the truth of said history. Cockcroft eventually reached a compromise with her design and depicted a working-class history of the town containing idealistic images of laborers. Despite her misgivings, the local residents were enthusiastic about the mural, and Cockcroft came to realize that everyone, even small-town conservatives, have the right to their own artistic expression.</p>

 <p>Jane Cortez (1934-2012) was an African-American poet, activist, small press publisher, and spoken-word performance artist whose voice is celebrated for its political, surrealistic, and dynamic innovations in lyricism and visceral sound. Her writing is part of the canon of the Black Arts Movement. Her poem “Do You Think” recalls stereotypes associated with Latinx culture, and describes how she is often subjected to these stereotypes because of her last name. She repeats the phrases “do you think” (this is a sad day, a sad night), as well as the refrain “full of tequila, full of el dorado, full of banana solitudes”.</p>

 <p>Carol Duncan (1936-) is a Marxist-feminist scholar known as a pioneer of “new art history”, a socio-political approach to art history and criticism. Having obtained her B.A. and M.A. from the University of Chicago and her Ph.D. from Columbia University, her work has centered around the examination of the critical role that museums play in the conservation of our collective history. “The Esthetics of Power in Modern Erotic Art” is an attempt to overwrite the notion of art’s inherent virtuosity purely due to its esthetic significance. Duncan argues against art ideologies that enforce the illusion that art is protected from moral judgment, and asserts that through the examination of erotic art, one finds affirmation of the relationship between male domination and female subjugation.</p> </div>

 <p>Mary Beth Edelson (1933-2021) was an American artist, pioneer of the first-generation feminist art movement, and member of the Heresies Collective. She was best known for her prints, photos, collages, and ritualistic performances. Death of the Patriarchy/Heresies is a collage in which Edelson cut and pasted the heads of the Heresies Collective members onto the heads of the figures in The Battle of Bunker’s Hill, painted by John Trumbull in 1786. Edelson has stated that in this work, the Heresies Collective is meant to be doing battle with the patriarchy. This work is part of a series of works (see her work Death of Patriarchy/A.I.R. Anatomy Lesson, 1976) in which Edelson revises traditional paintings from a feminist perspective. Through the use of collage, Edelson inserts women into works that have historically excluded them and essentially reinserts the female perspective back into the art-historical narrative.</p>

 <p>Barbara Ehrenreich (1941-) is an American author, political activist, and democratic socialist. Ehrenreich believes that socialist feminism is a term that can begin to express all of our concerns in a way that simply “socialist” and “feminist” could not. She then goes on to explain the historical and theoretical meanings behind Marxism and feminism, seeing a similarity in that “both analyses compel us to look at a fundamental injustice” (Ehrenreich 5). But this blanket term leads to concern in that it creates an aura of sectarianism. Regardless of the flaws of the term, Ehredich believes that it recognizes the cultural and social totality of capitalism while acknowledging the different settings and forms that oppression of women take.</p>

 <p>Louise Fishman (1939-2021) was an American abstract painter. Her work drew inspiration from feminism and Jewish cultures. Her painting,  Angry Harmony, part of the Angry series, is acrylic and pastel on paper, 30” x 40”. Angry Harmony was featured in the essay, “Feminist Abstract Art- A Political Viewpoint”, where Fisher is quoted saying “Betsy looked at the work and recognized the fact that I worked to survive, to keep from going crazy, and to keep the pain from becoming too great” (Hammond 67). Her canvas has thick lines spanning the perimeter and splitting the painting in half. On top of the borders are loosely painted diagonal lines and x’s. On the left half of the painting appears the letters “ANG”, with “RY”. On the other half is “HAR” with “MONY” below it. The letters are scrawled, and they feature multiple layers of varying brush sizes and paint drips. She believes that this painting functions as a place for personal confrontation and as a statement directed toward other people.</p>

 <p>Black Women, by Vanita Green (1970), was initially the token of women’s participation in the 
 Chicago mural movement. She began the mural at 17, after being inspired by William Walker’s own mural, Understanding Peace and Salvation Wall of Understanding. Her mural initially included portraits of famous historical and mythical black women, but shortly after it was defaced with splashes of white paint. Green responded by saying “Before it was just a pretty picture, but it says more now” (Cockcroft 14). This was one of the first defacements of public art in Chicago.</p>

 <p>a Paris-based collective based on “The Group of Five”, who in an essay share a representation of the prison and the personal experiences of the women involved. Its members consist of videographers, painters, sculptures, drawers, and poets from France, Turkey, Canada, and America. The members are Martine Aballea (1950-) who joined the project and contributed by writing about her memories, Judy Blum (?), who Met Nil at a daycare through their children, Nicole Croiset (1950-)who concentrated on the esthetic/sociological aspects of the research, Mimi (?)who was imprisoned for robbery, shares her experiences through her own personal experience, and Nil Yalter (1938-)who was the videographer. </p>
 <p>In a narrative, first person form, Mimi, who has been detained at a prison in Paris’s 11th arrondissement offers an elaboration of her experiences. She explains Women from all social classes and sexual orientations were imprisoned for bad checks, prostitution, robbery, and murder. There was favoritism and unfair treatment given by the nuns, so as stated by Mimi, it was crucial to have friends in order to survive the prison. Since the prison gave you no basic necessities, you had to work for at least about 10 days before you gathered enough money to buy something from the canteen. So If you had no one to send you money, you were left with nothing unless you made connections. In general relations between inmates were pretty good, but there were fights over cigarettes. If you could fight you were respected.</p>
 <p>The “cooler” was their punishment, they would receive no mail or visits, which led to the “yoyo system” ,where the inmates helped those who were punished pass notes from cell to cell. The women lived in dirty conditions, with lice, minimum heat provided by one stove in the hall, for forty cells. So People knitted in the winter, burned boxes, and blankets made out of skirts. Hunger was also prevalent, leading to People to buy magazines and eat the pictures of food. During the showers, the cubicles did not close, they were for multiple women, and the tempreture or length could not be controlled. They lived under rules such as a dress code of only dresses and skirts. It was forbidden to sing in the cells once the doors were closed, cells were searched with an invasion of privacy. Letters between inmates were allowed, but not romantically. Everything from the outside was also searched, they received their packages all cut up and opened letters were read, and sometimes wouldn't pass because they were too long. Letters leaving the prison were also censored regarding their living conditions in the prison.</p>

 <p>Unity Eye, a mural located on Haight and Shrader Streets, in San Francisco, California. The mural was painted by the Haight-Ashbury Muralists, led by Jane Norling, in 1973. The group identified themselves as “anti-imperialist cultural workers” (Cockcroft 19). Unity Eye, attempts to diagram the ingredients necessary for creating revolution in the United States. The mural is shaped like a large eye, where the pupil is divided into six equal pieces, showing groups of women in different stages of revolution. On the outer ring is a collection of words “unity, collective work, faith, creativity, shared connections, and purpose” which relate to the adjacent piece. Inside of the larger circle is a smaller one with one woman in the center, surrounded by a ring with the words “self determination”. The Haight-Ashbury Muralists have painted other murals, notably Rainbow People (1972, 1974), as well as Our History is No Mystery, a 300 ft mural in the parking lot of John Adams Community College, depicting class struggle.</p>

This article touches on new abstract forms for revolutionary art, and the creation of art in the context of other women’s art and feminist theory. She uses examples of contemporary feminist abstract artists such as Joan Synder, Louise Fishman, and Jenny Snider, to articulate the inherent politicization of feminist art, and therefore feminist abstract art.</p>

 <p>Suzanne Lacy (b. 1945) is an artist, writer, and professor at the USC Roski School of Art and Design in California. Her book Rape Is is referenced in Ruth E. Iskin’s Essay, ‘“Female Experience in Art’: The Impact of Women’s Art in a Work Environment.” Rape Is is features a stark white cover with a red circle sticker in the middle with the word “RAPE” printed on it. In order to open the book, the viewer must destroy this sticker, enacting what Iskin describes as a “metaphorical rape (‘deflowering’ the book by tearing the sticker).” Inside, Lacy names 21 instances of rape as taken from sexual assault survivors. While some of these instances are physical in nature, others are psychological. This unconventional approach to defining rape makes the viewer question how they percieve rape, opposes the traditional depiction of rape in art history, which usually represents the experience of the rapist rather than the victim, and challenges the social perception of rape.</p>

 <p>Lucy Lippard (1937-) is an American art critic, writer, activist, curator, and co-founder of Heresies collective. Her essay, “The Glass Swan: Upward and Downward Mobility in the Art World” explains the class system and status that is intrinsically tied to the making, selling, and purchasing of art. Artists are devalued, for they have no control over their art and its (mis)uses. Artists are often placed on the lowest rung in this class system, although they often emulate a socio-economic class that is not representative of their own, displaying either upward or downward mobility. Often art movements or styles such as process art (most of which exclude women) are claimed by and defined to be for certain class groups. Lippard argues that women artists are confined by class but need to move beyond these divides. They must speak to all audiences, establish a sense of community, cross class boundaries, and have control over their art.</p>

 <p>Marisol Escobar (1930-2016), better known simply as Marisol, was a Venezuelan-American artist most associated with the Pop art movement. While her work gained international recognition in the mid-1960s, it is relatively unknown today. However, Marisol did have a major retrospective show organized by the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art in 2014. Untitled is a colored pencil drawing from 1968 that depicts two hands connecting to form a heart. The hands appear to be formed by many multi-colored stripes, which swirl around the page in a surreal fashion. The work appears in Heresies under the heading, “Now Women Repossess Their Own Sexuality.” Despite the lack of information to be found on this work, much of Marisol’s other work spoke upon the prescribed social roles and restraints faced by women during the post-war period, and untitled likely articulates similar themes. By parodying the patriarchal values of femininity (i.e. being a good seductress, wife, and mother), she comments upon the social construct of womanhood in her work.</p>

 <p>Mandy Martin (1952-2021) was an Australian painter, printmaker, and educator. She was 
 involved in the feminist art movement in Australia during the 1970’s, and worked with the Progressive Art Movement - a leftist group working with Australian prisons and labor unions - alongside artist Ann Newmarch. This untitled photograph was featured in the “Posters from Australia” section of Heresies, alongside works by Ann Newmarch and Toni Robertson. The black &amp; white photo depicts women walking around at a railroad station. In the foreground of the image are three women walking over the train tracks, donning overalls, gloves, and boots. Based on their appearances we can deduce that these women, as well as those in the background, work at the station. Martin’s involvement with labor unions was likely the motivation for taking this photograph of working women.</p>

The group expanded to include more women over time, eventually becoming a collaborative group. The goal of Latinoamérica, was to depict the Latinx community at the present moment. The Latinx community was extremely grateful for the representation, the mural was publicized on TV and in newspapers, and members would bring their children to show them their heritage. Folks also brought gifts for the painters: beer, tamales, flowers, etc. to show their thanks.

 <p>Carol Muske (1945-) is an American poet, novelist, essayist, critic, and professor and former poet laureate for the United States. Muske begins by detailing an article she wrote for the Village Voice, about a strike in a women’s prison, in which the inmates demanded educational tools. Muske had been teaching a writing workshop for a year and was surprised at the enthusiasm and writing experience the prisoners already had, some of the poems by prisoners are included in the article. One prisoner wrote an eloquent but explicit poem about homosexuality, which she passed around to the inmates, it was found by a warden and confiscated, and both Muske and the writer received serious consequences. After a conversation about the type of poems that could be circulated, the class called “FREE SPACE” flourished, others came to teach and many famous writers came to speak. Some of the inmates got their poems published in feminist magazines, and later the group was able to turn some of their poems into an anthology, and later a video. Despite the success, the program (now called ART WITHOUT WALLS) was abruptly canceled, though a children’s center, drug clinic, and the writing program at a different women’s prison still remain.</p>

Gaol Bosses; Not Workers is a color screenprint featured in Heresies’ “Posters from Australia” section. While printed in black &amp; white in the magazine, the poster was in fact printed in brown and blue ink on yellow paper. The original poster is currently housed at the Art Gallery of South Australia. The subject matter for the poster is a photo of Australian workers protesting the involvement of United States bosses in Australia. The central focus of the photo is undeniably the large banner that proclaims “GAOL BOSSES; NOT WORKERS!” (The word “gaol” is an alternative spelling for the word “jail” that is used in Australia.) Newmarch’s poster highlights the fight of working-class Australians against U.S. involvement as they call for their independence as a nation.</p>

In this poster, which was originally printed in yellow, red, and brown ink, Newmarch has collaged various images to comment upon the domestic roles of women in society. A magazine clipping declaring that “one of the best traveling trips… is to look rich,” is shown next to a nude figure of a woman keeled over in pain. Juxtaposing the woman’s body is a Women’s Weekly magazine cover featuring Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia Loren. Newmarch’s use of juxtaposition and satire critiques consumer culture and emphasizes the physical and psychological pressure the media puts on women to look and act in a way that will make them desirable or will make them be perceived as good wife and mother.</p>

 <p>Women, by People’s painters, is a painting located in the Women’s Center, in Livingston College, 
 New Jersey. The painting looks in the style of stained-glass windows, because of the thick dense black outlines. In the center of the painting are four women, the lowermost person is no more than a circle and legs. The beings morph into women as they move to the upper center of the painting. Above the tallest woman is a quote reading “born again from who I was to become who I am”. Directly on either side of the women are circular shapes, beyond that is half of the people’s faces. Part of their hands is also seen. While there are no details about the painting, it is featured in the “Women in the Community Mural Movement '', therefore it can be assumed that this image is a mural. The People’s Painters is referenced in the text as a women’s mural-painting collective with Marxist and feminist roots. This group was modeled after the Ramona Parra Brigades of Allende’s Chile, their goal was trying to overcome individualism and a sense of personal ego. The design was chosen collectively, and the painting was layered so no one person could claim an individual piece.</p>

 <p>This multi-page spread features images of posters from the People’s Republic of China. There are 
 four posters total: Seagull, Little Eagle Spreads Her Wings, Spring Plowing, and Women Hold Up 
 Half the Sky. Each poster appears to have been provided by “eeva-inkeri”, but no biographical information on this individual has been found. Each of the posters features an illustration of a woman or women engaging in a laborious physical task. In Seagull, a woman in workwear or a military uniform is standing on a telephone pole in stormy conditions. In Little Eagle Spread Her Wings, there are three women on horseback carrying guns. In the background, people on horseback carry flags. In Spring Plowing, there are many women in a field, organized in a vertical line, all working to harvest and plant a crop. An internet search shows that this work is also referred to as Spring Hoeing, and is likely to be done by Chinese artist Li Fenglan (李凤兰) in 1974 (see link here). In the last poster, Women Hold Up Half the Sky, a woman is holding a hammer in her left hand and a large nail in her right hand. She wears a proud, content expression on her face. These propaganda posters show how the Maoist Communist Party of China portrayed its ideal female citizens as happy, hard workers engaging in roles typically designated for men (more information here).</p>

 <p>Julia Reichert (b. 1946) is an American Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker and feminist. Her documentaries explore people’s unique experiences of class, race, and gender in America. Union Maids is a documentary directed by Julia Reichert, Jim Klein, and Miles Mogulescu nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The film is based on the story of three women in the labor history book Rank and File by Staughton Lynd and Alice Lynd. The women lived in Chicago during the American labor movement in the 1930’s, and in order to bring their stories to life, Reichert relied upon their own oral histories as well as footage from the National Archives. Reichert’s use of primary sources weaves a realistic narrative that chronicles the fight to form industrial unions as seen through the eyes of working-class women in America. </p>

 <p>Adrienne Rich (1929-2012) was an American poet and essayist. Her poetry served as central texts for the second-wave feminist movement during the 1970’s and 1980’s, and is widely acclaimed for its confrontational examination of issues such as sexism, racism, and the Vietnam War. In the essay, “Women and Honor,” Rich shares her concern with relationships between and among women. She introduced the idea that “honor” has an entirely different connotation for men and women. Whereas for men honor is not something to be proven, as it is often assumed that a man will have it, for women honor is something that must be earned through virginity, chastity, and fidelity to a husband. Rich also speaks about truthfulness: while men are expected to tell the truth about facts but not feelings (but they usually lie all of the time, according to Rich), women are often expected to lie about their emotions and relationships, oftentimes doing so through their bodies. Rich then proclaims that the institution of heterosexuality, and the idea of honor that comes along with it, has silenced women’s love for women, forcing them to have to lie, stay silent, and fill the resulting void in their lives with children instead. Rich asserts that truthfulness must be created among people in order for women to begin to understand their own truths, and to cultivate their own sense of honor in a heterosexual, patriarchal society.</p>

 <p>Rivolta Femminile was an Italian group of radical feminists founded in Rome in July 1970. The group was founded by Carla Lonzi (1931-1982), Carla Accardi (1924-2014), and Elvira Banotti (1933-2014). Rivolta Femminile has consistently resisted male dominated institutions and have even developed its own feminist theory. This essay serves as a refusal to pay tribute to male creativity. A statement from the text reads, “To celebrate male creativity is ultimately to submit to the historic sovereignty of men.” The group believes that women’s liberation is only possible once women become truly independent from the patriarchy. The patriarchal world is reliant upon women, and by releasing themselves from this bond, women’s unique creativity may finally be realized.</p>

 <p>Toni Robertson (b. 1953) is an artist and art historian from Sydney, Australia. She is best known for her print and poster making as well as her involvement in the Earthworks Poster Collective in Sydney. Sometimes We Do Offend, Girls is a screen-printed poster included in “Posters from Australia.” The poster depicts an image of a used tampon alongside a woman drawn in a Pop art style. A thought bubble rises above her head containing the statement “I’d die if they saw the stain!”. In the bottom left corner of the poster, the text reads: “The reproductive function of a woman is the only innate function which distinguishes women from men. It is the critical distinction upon which all inequities toward women are grounded. A woman’s menstruation is a sign of her ability to bear children.” When selling prints of this poster, Robertson numbered it as 4/28, “as tampon came from day 4 of my period and 28 days is another myth.” In this work, Robertson uses humor and irony to destigmatize the period and comment on how it has become so negatively perceived that even women are embarrassed by their own bodily functions.</p>

In efforts to maintain this job, the woman is forced to continuously cross and recross the border, risking detention by guards. She also endures several challenges, including sexual assault, withheld wages, and microaggressions by white patrons. The novel includes two recipes: a peanut butter and jelly sandwich recipe, and a stuffed chili peppers recipe titled “With sauce for a Party.” The final postcard notes that Rosler’s friends helped translate the work into Spanish and that Rosler would send an English translation of the work for a small compensation.</p>

 <p>Joan Semmel (b. 1932) is an American feminist painter, writer, and professor. She is known for her nude self-portraits painted from exaggerated perspectives. Mythologies and Me is a triptych oil painting of three nude women. The woman in the center is depicted from a sharp top-down angle, as though through her own point-of-view. She is painted hyper-realistically and stands apart from the other two women, who are depicted from a straight-on angle more typically seen in portraiture. While the leftmost woman’s chest area is realistic, her face and limbs have been left unfinished. The woman on the right is entirely different in style, as she is painted in the manner of an abstract expressionist. This range of approaches to painting a woman’s body reflects the multifaceted critique Semmel makes on male fantasies about women’s bodies. In the center, Semmel has depicted her own body through her perspective. In contrast, the woman on the left is Semmel’s interpretation of an erotic image from a pornographic magazine, and the woman on the right serves as a parody of Willem de Kooning’s “Woman” series. Mythologies and Me appear in Heresies under the heading, “Now Women Repossess Their Own Sexuality.”</p>

 <p>Ann Leda Shapiro (b. 1946) is an American artist whose art weaves environmental issues, feminism, and science with autobiographical content. Her work was shown in a 1973 solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, but the Whitney censored two works by the artist - Anger and Two Sides of Self - after a public outcry over their sexually explicit imagery. Shapiro’s watercolor painting, Making Love to a Man Who Isn’t All There, appears in Heresies under the heading, “Now Women Repossess Their Own Sexuality.” The painting’s subject matter is surreal: surrounded by a black and starry night sky, two female figures are engaged in strange activities. One of the figures is seen lying on top of a skeleton in a floating bathtub, and they appear to be joined in a sexual embrace. Floating above the lovers, the second female figure reaches out her arms to what could be the sun, which seems to engulf her in its light. In the composition, we also see a planet with a rainbow ring floating in the sky, and a chain of disembodied arms extending outwards to the bottom right corner. While the meaning of this work remains unclear, all of these elements come together to create a whimsical, futuristic, and contemplative scene. Further, the title suggests that this work may be Shapiro’s depiction of a one-sided love with a man. Does the skeleton represent this man, as the female figure tries so desperately to hold onto what little remains of him and his love?</p>

 <p>Amy Sillman (b. 1955) is a New york-based artist. She was part of the Heresies collective and was the recipient of numerous awards, including a Guggenheim fellowship in 2000. While Sillman is best known for her abstract paintings, she also engages in nontraditional media including zines, cartoons, and animation. A Pink Strip is a four-panel comic for which Sillman did the illustrations. The accompanying text was done by the Deep Six (no information was able to be found on them). A Pink Strip serves as a satirical representation of how women are treated in the art world. Through quirky illustrations and sardonic text, Sillman and the Deep Six shed light on the inequalities that women regularly face while trying to establish themselves as artists. The four panels depict crowds of men and women conversing at various locations (in the bar, at the C-R group, on the picket line, in the studio) about women in the arts. In speech bubbles above their heads, men make ludicrous statements (i.e. “I thought they had a woman at that gallery,”) while women announce their frustrations (i.e. “When he put out a cigarette on my newest painting… I knew he wasn’t supportive”). By utilizing the simplicity of the comic strip, Sillman and the Deep Six make the frustrations of women artists easily digestible and understandable for a wider audience. </p>

 <p>Jenny Snider (b. 1972) is an American artist. According to her website, Snider finds inspiration in  
 memory, in both personal and shared cultural/historical contexts. Her work focuses on narrating these memories through various media. Her abstract drawing, Split Scribble, depicts a chaotic assortment of small scribbled lines. As the title suggests, the drawing is split down the middle, with one half having more lines and the other half having significantly fewer. Split Scribble appears in Heresies Issue 1 in the essay, “Feminist Abstract Art - A Political Viewpoint,” by Harmony Hammond. In the essay, Hammond states that the work of female abstract artists often gets grouped together with that of male abstract artists simply because of the nature of the modernist tradition. Hammond argues that works such as Split Scribble are in actuality deeply feminine. She believes that Snider’s drawing is about her nervousness and vulnerability as a woman, and the repetitive marks that she makes on the paper are representative of her own self as she navigates her feelings and image in relation to other people and spaces. Snider herself describes this work as “figurative,” despite not having a direct reference to the body.</p>

 <p>Joan Snyder (b. 1940) is an American abstract painter and original member of the Heresies collective. She is the recipient of numerous awards, notably: the MacArthur and Guggenheim fellowships. Small Symphony for Women II is a triptych of small square paintings appearing in the article, “Feminist Abstract Art - A Political Viewpoint,” by Harmony Hammond. All three paintings are abstract. The far-right sports geometric blocks of color, painted primarily in warm earth tones. Similarly, the painting on the left features a small black square in the upper-right corner but distinguishes itself with the inclusion of handwritten text. The central painting differs from those aforementioned, with its dark purple and blue palette and chaotically-scribbled brushstrokes, but there is a sense of unity in the inclusion of certain colors (red, yellow, black) throughout all three works. In this work, Snyder uses words and marks interchangeably as abstract gestures, and she experiments with cutting and burning the canvas. Snyder’s passionately chaotic paintings mimic the violence inflicted upon women and also speak about the ambiguities and difficulties of being a feminist artist in a patriarchal society.</p>

 <p>Nancy Spero (1926-2009) was an American feminist artist and activist. Her work is characterized by its expressive and unapologetic figurative interpretation of social and political issues such as power and violence, racism and Western privilege, and male dominance. Bomb Shitting is a gouache and ink drawing depicting grotesque phallic imagery. Reds, blacks, and browns pervade the color palette. In this work, Spero associates the male phallus with a bomb. Small heads, which spew what we can assume is blood, appear to fall out of one end of the phallus. The title of the work, Bomb Shitting, overtly references this imagery. On the other end of the phallus, we see two larger heads also ejecting red from their mouths. As a whole, the work brings up feelings of anger and disgust, which reflect Spero’s own feelings towards the Vietnam war. Spero made this work and many others as a protest of the war and as a staunch declaration of her feminist beliefs. Her combination of male imagery with war imagery offers a critique of the patriarchy and unapologetically blames it for the terror and violence brought on by the Vietnam war.</p>

 <p>Anita Steckel (1930-2012) was a feminist artist based in New York City. She was known for her paintings and photomontages which used erotic imagery to fight against censorship and the double standard present in representations of men vs. women. The Subway appears in Heresies under the heading, “Now Women Repossess Their Own Sexuality.” The work is a 3’ x 4’ collage depicting a woman sitting in between two men on the subway. The woman’s breasts and pubic area are exposed, while the men are fully clothed. With one hand, she reaches into the lap of the man left of her, and with the other, she unapologetically touches herself. As is characteristic of many of her collages, Steckel has placed an image of her face atop the body of the figure in the photo. She stares directly into the camera, appearing to challenge the viewer. The Subway subverts the expectation of female subjugation and instead shows a woman in a position of power, confidently resisting male domination.</p>

Tribute to Rosa Luxemburg is a collage that Stevens made in commemoration of Rosa Luxemburg, a Polish revolutionary socialist and anti-war activist. The collage includes both image and text, and a caption to the side of the work reads: “Secret Letter to her friend, Fanny, written from prison in urine on a page of French poetry, dated probably 1917. Her cell at Wronke 1916-1917. Her murderer, Runge, the man in the center with the drooping mustache, at the Eden Hotel, Berlin, January 16, 1917.” With this collage, Stevens sought to highlight the little-known experiences of incarcerated women. Further, Tribute to Rosa Luxemburg, along with Stevens’ other collage Two Women, can be found in Heresies before an essay by Carol Muske titled, “The Art of Not Bowing: Writing by Women in Prison.”</p>

 <p>“Pat Sweeney is an active member of the Wages for Housework Committee and one of the founders of the Nassau County Women's Liberation Center”. She states housework is already controlled and institutionalized; Mother’s day is an example; the work is unwaged and society is organized to force women into this job. Women are forced into jobs by society, casuing their power to be undermined, since no wage is offered, since housework is not seen as work, but rather a part of female nature. If you do not oblige to society, you are considered ”bad” because “ In this society to be a good woman- or just to be a woman is to be a good servant”. Womens work does not just consist of washing dishes or laundry, they produce and reproduce workers, plus their housework makes every other work possible.“Women make the workers who make the cars.And to make a worker is much more time- and energy- consuming job than to make a car!” Women freely donate their work to their husband and children and everyone bossses because their lives are governed by the same work schedule as “those they serve”. The quality and quantitiy of workers is also controlled through welfare and sterilization. Women are constantly controlled, lesbianism and teenage sex are illegal, yet rape in the family is not a crime. Women are not payed because with money comes power, and the ability to leave.They must not “propose the right to work” because it undermines their already existing work. Women just intensify their workload, because now they must do both, and the money they raise immediately disappears. Women intend to demand wages for housework from the government since the economy already benefits from their contribuation and since the government “is responsible for guaranteeing an adequate labor force to industry”. This can all be funded by taxing corporations, instead of citizens since programs such as welfare, are not enough. This will continue to break down restrictions because “... even a little money has begun to break down some of the most powerful mechanisms of discipline which traditionally have kept us in line.”</p>

 <p>Pat Sweeney was a member of the Wages for Housework Committee, a grassroots women’s 
 networking campaign advocating for women to earn wages for the domestic labor done in the home. The committee was founded by Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Silvia Federici, Brigitte Galtier, and Selma James. In the essay, “Wages for Housework: The Strategy for Women’s Liberation” Sweeney argues that women must be financially compensated for the work they do within the home because, without their work, their husbands would not be able to do theirs. Without women having dinner on the table every night, taking care of the kids every day, washing their husband's work uniforms, or providing the “Saturday night screw that keeps them going for yet another week at the assembly line or desk”, men would not be able to perform their jobs. Patriarchal attitudes will say that this kind of domestic care and servitude is within the “female nature” and women do it out of love for their families, when in reality women’s lives are controlled by their husband’s bosses and work schedules just as the men are. However, recognizing the work women do as paid labor is threatening because women with money are women with the power to leave. Sweeney’s essay highlights all the reasons women should be compensated for their labor and all the reasons why this is something that patriarchy fears.</p>

 <p>Faith Wilding (1943-) is a Paraguayan American multidisciplinary artist. She is also an author, educator, and activist widely known for her contribution to the progressive development of feminist art. Her work, Chrysalis II, a graphite and watercolor drawing (42” x 38”), depicts a symmetrical icon, which looks like an opening of a seed. Two sprouts emerge from the top, and surrounding this is a drawn symmetrical frame, with similar iconography around the edges, and what seems to be the planet Saturn in the corners. Appearing within the article, “‘Female Experience in Art’: The Impact of Women’s Art in a Work Environment,” Wilding is quoted discussing the collision of the personal and the political in the feminist movement. She also speaks to the power of female transformative experience.</p>

 <p>Susan Yankowitz (1941-) is an American dramatist and novelist. She works in a wide variety of genres and styles, but has a special focus on American themes and women characters. “ABCs” is a short story written in 26 parts, each of which begins with a letter of the alphabet (i.e. “An Apple,” “Breasts,” Chyme”). It follows the fictional events of a man named Manuelo Manchik consuming a woman, of whom he refers to as “Olympia,” and the escape of the woman, whose real name is Claire, from Manuelo’s stomach. While surreal in nature, the story discusses important issues surrounding male desire, sexuality, and violence towards women, and emphasizes the resiliency of women.</p>

 <p>Nancy Youdelman (b. 1948) is a sculptor and educator living and working in California. Youdelman was part of the Feminist Art Program founded by Judy Chicago in 1970 and participated in the creation of Womanhouse in 1972. Youdelman is best known for her transformation of women’s garments into multi-media sculptures using found objects. An Homage to Lily Bart is a tableau featuring a life-cast figure lying in bed. As established by the title, this figure is intended to be Lily Bart, a character in Edith Wharton’s novel The House of Mirth. Youdelman has reconstructed the climactic scene from Wharton’s novel where Lily Bart, after losing her fortune and status, takes her own life by overdosing on sleeping pills. Youdelman has created an intricate and hauntingly-lifelike depiction of this scene: Lily Bart’s pale gray skin remains frozen and lifeless on an elaborately-made bed, the floor is scattered haphazardly with papers and fabrics, a bouquet of dead wilted flowers rests on an end table, and the sleeping drops that killed her lie open next to the bed. In this installation, Youdelman emphasizes the themes of passivity and death in order to acknowledge certain aspects of the female experience: economic reliance on men, victimization due to circumstances, and ultimate powerlessness in society and in one’s own life.</p>

 <p>Elizabeth Zelvin (1944-) is a writer and editor, in her poem “Adman”, she describes an interaction between herself and a man, who Zelvin mainly refers to as “you”,  who she hasn’t seen in a while. The last stanza and the first stanza both start with “twelve years”, also adding to the temporal element. She repeatedly uses the motif of steak, insinuating that the man and her have been to the restaurant multiple times. While not explicitly stated, this poem seems to describe a situation where herself (or a woman) owed the man a sexual experience (because he bought her a steak). But now, because of the revolution, there is not that same expectation.</p>

 <p>The Zucchini poem, by Elizabeth Zelvin, is written in six stanzas and free verse. Through literary devices including symbolization, personification,and repetition, growth and change are represented. There is a theme of defiance, with the comparison of a Zucchini in a garden and a woman. In the poem, the zucchini symbolizes a woman and is personified to crouch patiently “in her camouflage”. It is awaiting not only growth but change.</p>
