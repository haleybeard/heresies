			<note type="researchNote">Versions of this article have been presented at the Socialst
				Feminist Conference, Yellow Springs, Ohio, July 1975; at Women's Week, Brown
				University, April, 1976; and in WIN (June 3, 1976) as "What is Socialist
				Feminism?"</note>
			<div>
				<p> At some level, perhaps not too well articulated, socialist feminism has been
					around for a long time. You are a woman in a capitalist society. You get pissed
					off: about the job, about the bills, about your husband (or ex), about the kids'
					school, the housework, being pretty, not being pretty, being looked at, not
					being looked at (and either way, not listened to), etc. If you think about all
					these things and how they fit together and what has to be changed, and then you
					look around for some words to hold all these thoughts together in abbreviated
					form, you'd almost have to come up with something like "<rs
						key="socialist feminism" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2420666"
						>socialist feminism</rs>." </p>
				<p>A lot of us came to socialist feminism in just that way: we were reaching for a
					word/term/ phrase that would begin to express all of our concerns, all of our
					principles in a way that neither "socialist" nor "feminist" seemed to. I have to
					admit that most socialist feminists know are not too happy with the term
					"socialist feminist" either. On the one hand it is too long (l have no hopes for
					a hyphenated mass movement); on the other hand it is much too short for what is,
					after all, really socialist internationalist anti-racist anti-heterosexist
					feminism.</p>
				<p>The trouble with taking a new label of any kind is that it creates an instant
					aura of sectarianism. "Socialist feminism" becomes a challenge, a mystery, an
					issue in and of itself. We have speakers, conferences, articles on "socialist
					feminism"âthough we know perfectly well that either"socialism" or "feminism" is
					too huge and too inclusive to be a subject for any sensible speech, conference,
					or article. People, including avowed socialist feminists, ask themselves
					anxiously, "What is socialist feminism?" There is a kind of expectation that it
					is (or is about to be at any moment, maybe in the next speech, conference or
					article) a brilliant synthesis of world historical proportionsâan evolutionary
					leap beyond <persName key="Karl Marx" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9061"
						>Marx</persName>, <persName key="Sigmund Freud"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9215">Freud</persName> and <persName
						key="Mary Wollstonecraft" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101638"
						>Wollstonecraft</persName>. Or that it will turn out to be nothing, a fad
					seized on by a few disgruntied feminists and female socialists, a temporary
					distraction.</p>
				<p>I want to try to cut through some of the mystery which has grown up around
					socialist feminism. Here I am going to focus on our "theory"âthe way we look at
					and analyze the world. I am not going to deal with our total outlook as
					socialist feminists because I want to stick as closely as possible to the
					interface of the two main traditions we grow out ofâsocialism and feminism. </p>
				<p> A logical way to start is to look at socialism and feminism separately. How does
					a socialistâmore precisely a <rs key="Marxist"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12716775">Marxist</rs>âlook at the
					world? How does a <rs key="feminist"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34074720">feminist</rs> look at the
					world? To begin with, Marxism and feminism have something important in common:
					they are critical ways of looking at the world. Both rip away popular mythology
					and "common-sense wisdomâ and force us to look at experience in a new way. Both
					seek to understand the worldânot in terms of static balances and symmetries (as
					in conventional social science), but in terms of antagonisms. So they lead to
					conclusions which are jarring and disturbing at the same time that they are
					liberating. There is no way to have a Marxist or a feminist outlook and remain a
					spectator. To understand the reality laid bare by these analyses is to move into
					action to change it.</p>
				<p>Here I am going to restrict myself to what I see as the core insights of <rs
						key="Marxism" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7264">Marxism</rs> and
						<rs key="feminism" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7252">feminism</rs>,
					and state these as briefly and starkly as possible: Marxism (in 20 words or
					less) addresses itself to the class dynamics of capitalist society. Every social
					scientist knows that capitalist societies are characterized by more or less
					severe, systemic inequality. Marxism understands this inequality to arise from
					processes which are intrinsic to <rs key="capitalism"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6206">capitalism</rs> as an economic
					system. A minority of people (the capitalist class) own all the factories/
					energy sources/resources on which everyone else depends in order to live. The
					great majority (the working class) must, out of sheer necessity work, under
					conditions set by the capitalists, for the wages the capitalists pay. Since the
					capitalists make their profits by paying less in wages than the value of what
					the workers actually produce, the relationship between these two classes is
					necessarily one of irreconcilable antagonism: the capitalist class owes its very
					existence to the continued exploitation of the working class. What maintains
					this system of class rule is, in the last analysis, force. The capitalist class
					controls (directly or indirectiy) the means of organized violence represented by
					the stateâpolicemen, jails, etc. Only by waging a revolutionary struggle aimed
					at the seizure of state power can the working class free itself, and,
					ultimately, all people.</p>
				<p>Feminism addresses itself to another familiar inequality. All human societies are
					marked by some degree of inequality between the sexes. If we survey human
					societies at a glance, sweeping through history and across continents, we see
					that they have commonly been characterized<pb
						facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue01/images/01_007.jpg"
					/>by: the subjugation of women to male authority, both within the family and in
					the community in general; the objectification of women as a form of property; a
					sexual division of labor in which women are confined to such activities as
					childraising, performing personal services for adult males and specified
					(usually low-prestige) forms of productive labor. Feminists, struck by the
					near-universality of these things have looked for explanations in the biological
					"givensâ which underlie all human social existence: men are physically stronger
					than women on the average, especially compared to pregnant women or women who
					are nursing babies. Furthermore, men have the power to make women pregnant. Thus
					the forms that sexual inequality takesâhowever various they may be from culture
					to cultureârest, in the last analysis, on what is clearly a physical advantage
					males hold over females. That is to say, they rest on violence, or the threat of
					violence.</p>
				<p>The ancient, biological roots of male supremacyâthe fact of male violenceâare
					commonly obscured by the laws and conventions which regulate the relations
					between the sexes in any particular culture. But they are there, according to a
					feminist analysis. The possibility of male assault stands as a constant warning
					to "bad" (rebellious aggressive) women, and drives "good" women into complicity
					with male supremacy. The reward for being "good" ("pretty," submissive) is
					protection from random male violence and, in some cases, economic security.</p>
				<p>I hope I have written these capsule summaries of Marxism and feminism in such a
					way that some similarities of approach show through. Marxism rips away the myths
					about "democracy" and "pluralism" to reveal a system of class rule that rests on
					forcible exploitation. Feminism cuts through myths about "instinct" and romantic
					love to expose male rule as a rule of force. Both analyses compel us to look at
					a fundamental injustice. If either, or both, make you uncomfortable, they were
					meant to! The choice is to reach for the comfort of the myths or as Marx put it,
					to work for a social order which does not require myths to sustain it. Having
					gone to the trouble to provide these thumbnail sketches of Marxism and feminism,
					the obvious thing to do would be just to add them up and call the sum "socialist
					feminism." In fact, this is probably how most socialist feminists operate most
					of the timeâas a kind of hybrid, pushing feminism in socialist circles,
					socialism in feminist circles. Practically speaking, I think this is a perfectly
					reasonable way to operate a lot of the time. One trouble with leaving things
					like that, though, is that it keeps people wondering "Well, what is she really?"
					or demanding of us "What is the principal contradiction?" Such questions often
					stop us in our tracks: It sounds so compelling and authoritative and logical:
					"Make a choice! Be one or another!" Yet we know that there is a political
					consistency to socialist feminism. We are not hybrids or fence-sitters.</p>
				<p>To get to that political consistency we have to go beyond the capsule versions of
					Marxism and feminism I laid out. We have to differentiate ourselves, as
					feminists from other kinds of feminists, and as Marxists from other kinds of
					Marxists. We have to stake out a socialist feminist kind of feminism and a
					socialist feminist kind of socialism. Only then is there a possibility that
					things will "add up" to something more than an uneasy juxtaposition. </p>
				<p> First, what is our outlook as feminists and how is it different from that of
					other feminists? I think most radical feminists and socialist feminists would
					agree with my capsule characteriza- tion of feminism as far as it goes. The
					trouble with <rs key="radical feminism"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2914207">radical feminism</rs> from a
					socialist feminist point of view, is that it doesnât go any farther: it remains
					transfixed by the universality of male supremacy: things have never really
					changed; all social systems are "patriarchiesâ; imperialism, militarism and
					capitalism are all simply expressions of innate male aggressiveness. And so on. </p>
				<p>The problem with this is not only that it leaves out men (and the possibility of
					reconciliation with them on a truly human and egalitarian basis) but that it
					leaves out an awful lot about women. For example to discount a socialist country
					such as <placeName key="China" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29520"
						>China</placeName> as a "patriarchy"âas have heard some radical feminists
					doâis to ignore the real struggles and achievements of millions of women.
					Socialist feminists while agreeing that there is something timeless and
					universal about women's oppression, have insisted that it takes different forms
					in different settings, and that the differences are of vital importance. There
					is a difference between a society in which sexism is expressed by female
					infanticide and a society in which sexism takes the form of unequal
					representation on the Central Committee. And the difference is worth dying for. </p>
				<p>One of the historical variations on the theme of sexism which ought to concern
					all feminists is the set of changes that came with the transition from an
					agrarian society to industrial capitalism. This is no academic issue. The social
					system which industrial capitalism replaced was in fact a patriarchal one, and I
					am using that term now in its original sense to mean a system in which
					production is centered in the household and is presided over by the oldest male.
					The fact is that industrial capitalism came along and tore the rug out from
					under that system: production went into the factories; individuals broke off
					from the family to become "free" wage earners. To say that capitalism disrupted
					the patriarchal organization of production and family life is not, of course, to
					say that capital- ism abolished male supremacy! But the particular<pb
						facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue01/images/01_008.jpg"
					/>forms of sex oppression we experience today are, to a significant degree,
					recent developments. A huge historical discontinuity lies between us and true
					patriarchy. If we are to understand our experience as women today, we must move
					beyond the biological invariants of human experience to a consideration of
					capitalism as a system. </p>
				<p>There are other ways I could have gotten to the same point. I could have said
					simply that as feminists we are most interested in the most oppressed womenâpoor
					and working-class women, third-world womenâand for that reason we are led to a
					need to comprehend and confront captialism. I could have said that we need to
					address ourselves to the class system simply because women are members of
					classes But I am trying to bring out something else about our perspective: that
					there is no way to understand sexism as it acts on our livesânever mind class
					oppression for a minuteâwithout putting it in the historical context of
					capitalism. </p>
				<p>Now let'cs go on to our outlook as Marxists. Again, I think most socialist
					feminists would agree with my capsule summary as far as it goes. And the trouble
					again is that there are a lot of people (I'll call them "mechanical Marxists")
					who do not go any further. To these people, the only "real" and important things
					that go on in capitalist society are those that relate to the productive process
					or the conventional political sphere. From such a point of view, every other
					part of experience and social existenceâeducation, sexuality, recreation, the
					family, art, music, housework (you name it)âis peripheral to the central
					dynamics of social change; it is part of the "superstructure" or "culture."</p>
				<p>Socialist feminists are in a very different camp. We (along with many Marxists
					who are not feminists) see capitalism as a social and cultural totality. We
					understand that, in its search for markets, capitalism is driven to penetrate
					every nook and cranny of social existence. Especially in the monopoly capitalism
					phase, the realm of consumption is every bit as important, just from an economic
					point of view as the realm of production. So we cannot understand class struggle
					as something confined to issues of wages and hours, or confined only to
					workplace issues. Class struggle occurs in every arena where the interests of
					the classes conflict, and that includes education, health, the arts, etc. We aim
					to transform not only the ownership of the means of production, but the totality
					of social existence.</p>
				<p>So, as Marxists, we come to feminism from a completely different place than the
					"mechanical Marxists." Because we see monopoly capitalism as a
					political/economic/cultural totality, we have room within our Marxist framework
					for feminist issues which have nothing ostensibly to do with production or
					"politics " issues that have to do with "private" life. </p>
				<p> Furthermore, in our brand of Marxism, there is no "woman question," no big
					mystery about womenâbecause we never compartmentalized women off to the
					"superstructureâ in the first place. Marxists of a mechanical bent continually
					ponder the issue of the unwaged woman (the housewife): is she really a member of
					the working class? That is, does she really produce surplus value? We say, of
					course housewives are members of the working classânot because we have some
					elaborate proof that they really do produce surplus valueâbut because we
					understand a class as being composed of people, and as having a social existence
					quite apart from the capitalist-dominated realm of production. When we think of
					class in this way, then we see that in fact the women who seemed most peripheral
					the housewives are at the very heart of their classâraising children, holding
					together families, maintaining the culture and social networks of the community.
					So we are coming out of a kind of feminism and a kind of Marxism whose interests
					quite naturally flow together. I think we are in a position now to see why it is
					that socialist feminism has been such a great mystery. It is a paradox only as
					long as what you mean by socialism is really "mechanical Marxism" and what you
					mean by feminism is an ahistorical kind of radical feminism. These things donât
					add up; they have nothing in common. But if you put together another kind of
					socialism and another kind of feminism, as I have tried to define them, you do
					get some common ground. And that is one of the most important things about
					socialist feminism today: that it is a spaceâfree from the constrictions of a
					truncated kind of feminism and a truncated version of Marxismâa space in which
					we can develop the kind of politics that address the political/
					economic/cultural totality of monopoly capitalist society. We could go only so
					far with the available feminisms, the conventional Marxism, and then we had to
					break out to something that is not so restrictive and so incomplete in its view
					of the world. We had to take a new name, socialist feminism," in order to assert
					our determination to comprehend the whole of our experience and to forge a
					politics that reflects the totality of that comprehension. At that I may have
					fulfilled my mission of demystifying socialist feminism, but I don't want to
					leave this theory as a "space" or a common ground. Things are beginning to grow
					in that ground. We are closer to a synthesis in our understanding of sex and
					class capitalism and male domination, than we were a few years ago. Here l will
					indicate very sketchily one such line of thought:</p>
				<list>
					<item>1. The Marxist/feminist understanding that class and sex domination rest
						"ultimately" on force is correct, and this remains the most devastating
						critique of sexist/capitalist society. But there is a lot to that
						"ultimately." In a <pb
							facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue01/images/01_009.jpg"
						/> day-to-day sense, most people acquiesce to sex and class domination
						without being held in line by the threat of violence, and often without even
						the threat of material deprivation. </item>
					<item>2. It is very important, then, to figure out what, if not the direct
						application of force, keeps things going. In the case of class a great deal
						has been written already about why the American working class lacks militant
						class consciousness. Certainly ethnic divisions especially the Black/white
						division, are a key to the answer. But, I would argue, in addition to being
						divided, the working class has been socially atomized: working-class
						neighborhoods have been destroyed and allowed to decay; life has become
						increasingly privatized and inward-looking; skills once possessed by the
						working class have been expropriated by the capitalist class;
						capitalist-controlled "mass cultureâ has edged out almost all indigenous
						working-class culture and institutions. Instead of collectivity and
						self-reliance as a class there is mutual isolation and collective dependency
						on the capitalist class. </item>
					<item>3. The subjugation of women, in ways characteristic of late capitalist
						society, has been a key to this process of class atomization. To put it
						another way: the forces which have atomized working-class life and promoted
						cultural/material dependency on the capitalist class are the same forces
						which have served to perpetuate the subjugation of women. It is women who
						are most isolated in what has become an increasingly privatized family
						existence (even when they work outside the home too). It is, in many
						instances women's skills (productive skills, healing, midwifery) which have
						been discredited or banned to make way for commodities. It is, above all,
						women who are required to be utterly passive/uncritical/dependent (i.e.
						"feminine") in the face of the pervasive capitalist penetration of private
						life. Historically, late capitalist penetration of working-class life has
						singled out women as prime targets of pacification (or "feminization")
						because women are the culture-bearers of their class. </item>
					<item>4. It follows that there is a fundamental interconnectedness between
						women's struggle and what is traditionally conceived as class struggle. Not
						all women's struggles have an inherently anti-capitalist thrust
						(particularly not those which seek only to advance the power and wealth of
						special groups of women), but all those which build collectivity and
						collective confidence among women are vitally important to the building of
						class consciousness. Conversely, not all class struggles have an inherently
						anti-sexist thrust (especially not those which cling to pre-industrial
						patriarchal values) but all those which seek to build the social and
						cultural autonomy of the working class are necessarily linked to the
						struggle for women's liberation.</item>
				</list>
				<p>This is one direction which socialist feminist analysis is taking. No one is
					expecting a synthesis to emerge which will collapse socialist and feminist
					struggles into the same thing. The capsule summaries I gave earlier retain their
					"ultimate" truth: there are crucial aspects of capitalist domination (such as
					racial oppression) which a purely feminist perspective simply cannot account for
					or deal withâwithout bizarre distortions, that is. There are crucial aspects of
					sex oppression (such as male violence within the family) into which socialist
					thought has little insightâagain without a lot of stretching and distortion.
					Hence the need to continue to be socialists and feminists. But there is enough
					of a synthesis, both in what we think and what we do, for us to begin to develop
					a self-confident identity as socialist feminists. </p>
