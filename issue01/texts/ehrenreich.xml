						have been presented at the Socialst Feminist Conference, Yellow Springs,

			<p> At some level, perhaps not too well articulated, socialist feminism has been around
				for a long time. You are a woman in a capitalist society. You get pissed off: about
				the job, about the bills, about your husband (or ex), about the kids' school, the
				housework, being pretty, not being pretty, being looked at, not being looked at (and
				either way, not listened to), etc. If you think about all these things and how they
				fit together and what has to be changed, and then you look around for some words to
				hold all these thoughts together in abbreviated form, you'd almost have to come up
				with something like "socialist feminism." </p>
			<p>A lot of us came to socialist feminism in just that way: we were reaching for a
				word/term/ phrase that would begin to express all of our concerns, all of our
				principles in a way that neither "socialist" nor "feminist" seemed to. I have to
				admit that most socialist feminists know are not too happy with the term "socialist
				feminist" either. On the one hand it is too long (l have no hopes for a hyphenated
				mass movement); on the other hand it is much too short for what is, after all,
				really socialist internation= alist anti-racist anti-heterosexist feminism.</p>
			<p>The trouble with taking a new label of any kind is that it creates an instant aura of
				sectarianism. "Socialist feminism" becomes a challenge, a mystery, an issue in and
				of itself. We have speakers, conferences articles on "socialist feminism"—though we
				know perfectly well that either"socialism" or "feminism" is too huge and too
				inclusive to be a subject for any sensible speech, conference, or article. People,
				including avowed socialist feminists, ask themselves anxiously, "What is socialist
				feminism?" There is a kind of expectation that it is (or is about to be at any
				moment, maybe in the next speech, conference or article) a brilliant synthesis of
				world historical proportions—an evolutionary leap beyond Marx, Freud and
				Wollstonecraft. Or that it will turn out to be nothing, a fad seized on by a few
				disgruntied feminists and female socialists, a temporary distraction.</p>
			<p>I want to try to cut through some of the mystery which has grown up around socialist
				feminism. Here I am going to focus on our "theory"—the way we look at and analyze
				the world. I am not going to deal with our total outlook as socialist feminists
				because I want to stick as closely as possible to the interface of the two main
				traditions we grow out of—socialism and feminism. </p>
			<p> A logical way to start is to look at socialism and feminism separately. How does a
				socialist—more precisely a Marxist—look at the world? How does a feminist look at
				the world? To begin with, Marxism and feminism have something important in common:
				they are critical ways of looking at the world. Both rip away popular mythology and
				"common-sense wisdom“ and force us to look at experience in a new way. Both seek to
				understand the world—not in terms of static balances and symmetries (as in
				conventional social science), but in terms of antagonisms. So they lead to
				conclusions which are jarring and disturbing at the same time that they are
				liberating. There is no way to have a Marxist or a feminist outlook and remain a
				spectator. To understand the reality laid bare by these analyses is to move into
				action to change it.</p>
			<p>Here I am going to restrict myself to what I see as the core insights of Marxism and
				feminism, and state these as briefly and starkly as possible: Marxism (in 20 words
				or less) addresses itself to the class dynamics of capitalist society. Every social
				scientist knows that capitalist societies are characterized by more or less severe,
				systemic inequality. Marxism understands this inequality to arise from processes
				which are intrinsic to capitalism as an economic system. A minority of people (the
				capitalist class) own all the factories/ energy sources/resources on which every-
				one else depends in order to live. The great majority (the working class) must, out
				of sheer necessity work, under conditions set by the capitalists, for the wages the
				capitalists pay. Since the capitalists make their profits by paying less in wages
				than the value of what the workers actually produce, the relationship between
				these two classes is necessarily one of irreconcilable antagonism: the capitalist
				class owes its very existence to the continued exploit- ation of the working class.
				What maintains this system of class rule is, in the last analysis, force. The
				capitalist class controls (directly or indirectiy) the means of organized violence
				rep- resented by the state—policemen, jails, etc. Only by waging a revolutionary
				struggle aimed at the seizure of state power can the working class free itself, and,
				ultimately, all people.</p>
			<p>Feminism addresses itself to another familiar inequality. All human societies are
				marked by some degree of inequality between the sexes. If we survey human societies
				at a glance, sweep- ing through history and across continents, we see that they have
				commonly been character<pb n="5"/>ized by: the subjugation of women to male
				authority, both within the family and in the community in general; the
				objectification of women as a form of property; a sexual division of labor in which
				women are confined to such activities as childraising, performing personal services
				for adult males and specified (usually low-prestige) forms of productive labor.
				Feminists, struck by the near-universality of these things have looked for
				explanations in the biological "givens“ which underlie all human social existence:
				men are physically stronger than women on the average, especially compared to
				pregnant women or women who are nursing babies. Furthermore, men have the power to
				make women pregnant. Thus the forms that sexual inequality takes—however various
				they may be from culture to culture—rest, in the last analysis, on what is clearly a
				physical advantage males hold over females. That is to say, they rest on violence,
				or the threat of violence.</p>
			<p>The ancient, biological roots of male supremacy—the fact of male violence—are
				commonly obscured by the laws and conventions which regulate the relations between
				the sexes in any particular culture. But they are there, according to a feminist
				analysis. The possibility of male assault stands as a constant warning to "bad"
				(rebellious aggressive) women, and drives "good" women into complicity with male
				supremacy. The reward for being "good" ("pretty," submissive) is protection from
				random male violence and, in some cases, econ- omic security.</p>
			<p>I hope I have written these capsule sum- maries of Marxism and feminism in such a way
				that some similarities of approach show through. Marxism rips away the myths about
				democracy" and "pluralism" to reveal a system of class rule that rests on forcible
				exploitation. Feminism cuts through myths about "instinct" and romantic love to
				expose male rule as a rule of force. Both analyses compel us to look at a
				fundamental injustice. If either, or both, make you uncomfortable, they were meant
				to! The choice is to reach for the comfort of the myths or as Marx put it, to work
				for a social order which does not require myths to sustain it. Having gone to the
				trouble to provide these thumbnail sketches of Marxism and feminism, the obvious
				thing to do would be just to add them up and call the sum "socialist feminism." In
				fact, this is probably how most socialist feminists operate most of the time—as a
				kind of hybrid, pushing feminism in socialist circles, socialism in feminist
				circles. Practically speaking, Ithink this is a perfectly reasonable way to
				operate a lot of the time. One trouble with leaving things like that, though, is
				that it keeps people wondering "Well, what is she really?" or demanding of us "What
				is the principal contradiction?" Such questions often stop us in our tracks: It
				sounds so compelling and authoritative and logical: "Make a choice! Be one or
				another!" Yet we know that there is a political consistency to socialist feminism.
				We are not hybrids or fence-sitters.</p>
			<p>To get to that political consistency we have to go beyond the capsule versions of
				Marxism and feminism I laid out. We have to differentiate ourselves, as feminists
				from other kinds of feminists, and as Marxists from other kinds of Marxists. We have
				to stake out a socialist feminist kind of feminism and a socialist feminist kind
				of socialism. Only then is there a possibility that things will "add up" to
				something more than an uneasy juxtaposition. </p>
			<p> First, what is our outlook as feminists and how is it different from that of other
				feminists? I think most radical feminists and socialist feminists would agree with
				my capsule characteriza- tion of feminism as far as it goes. The trouble with
				radical feminism. from a socialist feminist point of view, is that it doesn’t go any
				farther: it remains transfixed by the universality of male supremacy: things have
				never really changed; all social systems are "patriarchies“; imperialism,
				militarism and capitalism are all simply expressions of innate male aggressiveness.
				And so on. </p>
			<p>The problem with this is not only that it leaves out men (and the possibility of
				reconciliation with them on a truly human and egalitarian basis) but that it leaves
				out an awful lot about women. For example to discount a socialist country such as
				China as a "patriarchy"—as have heard some radical feminists do—is to ignore the
				real struggles and achievements of millions of women. Socialist feminists while
				agreeing that there is something timeless and universal about women's oppression,
				have insisted that it takes different forms in different settings, and that the
				differences are of vital importance. There is a difference between a society in
				which sexism is expressed by female infanticide and a society in which sexism takes
				the form of unequal representation on the Central Committee. And the difference is
				worth dying for. </p>
			<p>One of the historical variations on the theme of sexism which ought to concern all
				feminists is the set of changes that came with the transition from an agrarian
				society to industrial capitalism. This is no academic issue. The social system
				which industrial capitalism replaced was in fact a patriarchal one, and I am using
				that term now in its original sense to mean a system in which production is centered
				in the household and is presided over by the oldest male. The fact is that
				industrial capitalism came along and tore the rug out from under that system:
				production went into the factories; individuals broke off from the family to become
				"free" wage earners. To say that capitalism disrupted the patriarchal organization
				of production and family life is not, of course, to say that capital- ism abolished
				male supremacy! But the particu<pb n="6"/>lar forms of sex oppression we
				experience today are, to a significant degree, recent developments. A huge
				historical discontinuity lies between us and true patriarchy. If we are to
				understand our experience as women today, we must move beyond the biological
				invariants of human experience to a consideration of capitalism as a system. </p>
			<p>There are other ways ! could have gotten to the same point. I could have said simply
				that as feminists we are most interested in the most oppressed women—poor and
				working-class women, third-world women—and for that reason we are led to a need
				to comprehend and confront captialism. I could have said that we need to address
				ourselves to the class system simply because women are members of classes But I am
				trying to bring out something else about our perspective: that there is no way to
				understand sexism as it acts on our lives—never mind class oppression for a
				minute—without putting it in the historical context of capitalism. </p>
			<p>Now let's go on to our outlook as Marxists. Again, I think most socialist feminists
				would agree with my capsule summary as far as it goes. And the trouble again is that
				there are a lot of people (I'll call them "mechanical Marxists") who do not go any
				further. To these people, the only "real" and important things that go on in
				capitalist society are those that relate to the productive process or the conventional political sphere. From such a point of view, every other part of experience
				and social existence—education, sexuality, recreation, the family, art, music,
				housework (you name it)—is peripheral to the central dynamics of social change; it
				is part of the "superstructure" or "culture."</p>
			<p>Socialist feminists are in a very different camp. We (along with many Marxists who
				are not feminists) see capitalism as a social and cultural totality. We understand
				that, in its search for markets, capitalism is driven to penetrate every nook and
				cranny of social existence. Especially in the monopoly capitalism phase, the realm
				of consumption is every bit as important, just from an economic point of view as the
				realm of production. So we cannot understand class struggle as something confined
				to issues of wages and hours, or confined only to workplace issues. Class struggle
				occurs in every arena where the interests of the classes conflict, and that includes
				education, health, the arts, etc. We aim to transform not only the ownership of
				the means of production, but the totality of social existence.</p>
			<p>So, as Marxists, we come to feminism from a completely different place than the
				"mechani- cal Marxists." Because we see monopoly capi- talism as a
				political/economic/cultural totality, we have room within our Marxist framework for
				feminist issues which have nothing ostensibly to do with production or "politics "
				issues that have to do with "private" life. </p>
			<p> Furthermore, in our brand of Marxism, there is no "woman question," no big mystery
				about women—because we never compartmentalized women off to the "superstructure“ in
				the first place. Marxists of a mechanical bent continually ponder the issue of the
				unwaged woman (the housewife): is she really a member of the working class? That
				is, does she really produce surplus value? We say, of course housewives are
				members of the working class—not because we have some elaborate proof that they
				really do produce surplus value–but because we under- stand a class as being
				composed of people, and as having a social existence quite apart from the
				capitalist-dominated realm of production. When we think of class in this way, then
				we see that in fact the women who seemed most peripheral the housewives are at the
				very heart of their class—raising children, holding together families, maintaining
				the culture and social networks of the community. So we are coming out of a kind of
				feminism and a kind of Marxism whose interests quite naturally flow together. I
				think we are in a position now to see why it is that socialist feminism has been
				such a great mystery. It is a paradox only as long as what you mean by socialism is
				really "mechanical Marxism" and what you mean by feminism is an ahistorical kind of
				radical feminism. These things don’t add up; they have nothing in common. But if
				you put together another kind of socialism and another kind of feminism, as I have
				tried to define them, you do get some common ground. And that is one of the most
				important things about socialist feminism today: that it is a space—free from the
				constrictions of a truncated kind of feminism and a truncated version of Marxism—a
				space in which we can develop the kind of politics that address the political/
				economic/cultural totality of monopoly capitalist society. We could go only so far
				with the available feminisms, the conventional Marxism, and then we had to break out
				to something that is not so restrictive and so incomplete in its view of the world.
				We had to take a new name, socialist feminism," in order to assert our determination to comprehend the whole of our experience and to forge a politics that
				reflects the totality of that comprehension. At that I may have fulfilled my mission
				of demystifying socialist feminism, but I don't want to leave this theory as a
				"space" or a common ground. Things are beginning to grow in that ground. We are
				closer to a synthesis in our understanding of sex and class capitalism and male
				domination, than we were a few years ago. Here l will indicate very sketchily one
				such line of thought:</p>
			<list>
				<item>1. The Marxist/feminist understanding that class and sex domination rest
					"ultimately" on force is correct, and this remains the most devastating critique
					of sexist/capitalist society. But there is a lot to that "ultimately." In a <pb n="7"/> day-to-day sense, most people acquiesce to sex and class domination
					without being held in line by the threat of violence, and often without even the
					threat of material deprivation. </item>
				<item>2. It is very important, then, to figure out what, if not the direct
					application of force, keeps things going. In the case of class a great deal has
					been written already about why the American working class lacks militant class
					consciousness. Certainly ethnic divisions especially the Black/white division,
					are a key to the answer. But, I would argue, in addition to being divided, the
					working class has been socially atomized: working-class neighborhoods have been
					destroyed and allowed to decay; life has become increasingly privatized and
					inward-looking; skills once possessed by the working class have been
					expropriated by the capitalist class; capitalist-controlled "mass culture“ has
					edged out almost all indigenous working-class culture and institutions. Instead
					of collectivity and self-reliance as a class there is mutual isolation and
					collective dependency on the capitalist class. </item>
				<item>3. The subjugation of women, in ways characteristic of late capitalist
					society, has been a key to this process of class atomization. To put it another
					way: the forces which have atomized working-class life and promoted cultural/
					material dependency on the capitalist class are the same forces which have
					served to perpetuate the subjugation of women. It is women who are most
					isolated in what has become an in- creasingly privatized family existence (even
					when they work outside the home too). It is, in many instances women's skills
					(productive skills, healing, midwifery) which have been discredited or banned
					to make way for commodities. It is, above all, women who are required to be
					utterly passive/uncritical/dependent (i.e. "feminine") in the face of the
					pervasive capitalist penetration of private life. Historically, late capitalist
					penetration of working-class life has singled out women as prime targets of
					pacification (or "feminization") because women are the culture-bearers of their
					class. </item>
				<item>4. It follows that there is a fundamental interconnectedness between women's
					struggle and what is traditionally conceived as class struggle. Not all women's
					struggles have an inherently anti-capitalist thrust (particularly not those
					which seek only to advance the power and wealth of special groups of women), but
					all those which build collectivity and collective confidence among women are
					vitally important to the building of class consciousness. Conversely, not all
					class struggles have an inherently anti-sexist thrust (especially not those
					which cling to pre-industrial patriarchal values) but all those which seek to
					build the social and cultural autonomy of the working class are necessarily
					linked to the struggle for women's liberation.</item>

			<p>This is one direction which socialist feminist analysis is taking. No one is
				expecting a synthesis to emerge which will collapse socialist and feminist struggles
				into the same thing. The capsule summaries I gave earlier retain their "ultimate"
				truth: there are crucial aspects of capitalist domination (such as racial
				oppression) which a purely feminist perspective simply cannot account for or deal
				with—without bizarre distor- tions, that is. There are crucial aspects of sex
				oppression (such as male violence within the family) into which socialist thought
				has little insight—again without a lot of stretching and distortion. Hence the need
				to continue to be socialists and feminists. But there is enough of a synthesis, both
				in what we think and what we do, for us to begin to develop a self-confident
				identity as socialist feminists. </p>
