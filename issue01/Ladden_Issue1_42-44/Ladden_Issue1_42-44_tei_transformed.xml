				<p>The smile of my gracious lady makes me happier
				than if four hundred angels laughed at me from
				the heavens (Raimbaut d'Orange, while some
				less gracious ladies chuckled from
				the wings.)
				The attitudes in True Romances (and in most
				of our pasts) originally shone forth from 12th-
				century troubadour poetry and even then they
				were a little tarnished. Chaste, idealistic and
				upper-ciass, medieval troubadour poetry sup-
				posedly countered a strong tradition of misog-
				yny. It also supposedly elevated woman by up-
				holding that same feminine mystique which, for
				centuries, the Christian fathers had diligently)
				tried to demolish: “Corporeal beauty is nothing
				else but phlegm, and blood, and humor, and
				bile, and the fluid of masticated food.... "
				said John Chrysostom, a saint, in the 4th cen-
				tury. "When you see a rag with any of these
			</p>
         <p>things on it, such as phlegm, or spittle, you
				cannot bear to touch it even with the tips of
				your fingers. . . . Are you in a flutter of excite-
				ment about the storehouses and depositories of
				these things?"1
				Woman was so many layers of mucous mem-
				brane. And writings from 6 and 7 centuries later
				attest to the muddy strides saints and clerics
				had taken in the interim: "If her bowels and
				flesh were cut open, you would see what filth is
				covered by her white skin. If a fine crimson
				cloth covered a pile of foul dung, would anyone
				be foolish enough to love the dung because of
				it?"2 Now, woman was simply so much manure
				smattered across the coprophagous pages of
				Christian doctrine.
				The wheels of progress kept on turning. A
				3th-century work addressed itself specifically
				to women—three worthy recluses: "What fruit
				does your flesh yield from all its openings?"
				began their catechism. “Between the taste of
				mouth and smell of nose, aren’t there holes like
				two privy holes? Aren’t you born of foul slime?
				Arent you worm-food?3 To the Church, wom-
				an was simply full of shit. Yet this was the
				legacy bequeathed to the Middle Ages where
				the love of woman was a cult—an absolute pre-
				requisite for respectability. And love flourished.
				Of course, misogyny continued to flourish
				too. Woman would still be called "a stinking
				rose" and "glittering mud” and “a temple built
				over a sewer."4 But, as sister to Mary, she was
				also the mystical elevator of the masculine soul
				which, by its nature, gravitated toward perfec-
				tion. By merely contemplating woman in her
				golden radiance, man could rise to spiritual
				heights in a kind of "gilt” by association. For
				somewhere between the muddy slime and the
				hazy castle spire, a new woman had been
				spawned. Like the enchanted fay (fairy) of Celt-
				ic lore, she moved softly, gliding over but never
				touching terra firma, surrounded by auras so
				fragile that they were better left unpenetrated.
				But these were beautiful, mysterious and prom-
				ising auras, and scribes feverishly copied down
				the formulas for keeping them intact: "If you
				have ugly teeth, dort laugh with your mouth
				open. " "Practice making pretty speeches. “ "Dye
				your hair; wear false hair if you have lost your
				own."5
				Andreas Capellanus, Jacques D'Amiens Rob-
				ert le Blois, Garin le Brun, Drouart la Vache,
				Ermangau and de Fournival —all added their
				instructions to the heap: Lie. Cheat. Drop
				names, if you have to. Drop dead, if you have
				to. Anything.
				Maintaining the mystique was the important
				thing, and that meant keeping the distance. It
				meant the ecstasy was in the wooing while sex
				lay in the winding down. Even the ladies under-
				stood that attainment decreased their value,
				and many who loftily kept their suitors well
				below thigh level would rather have had it
				otherwise. After all, as even the ladies knew: a
			</p>
         <pb n="2"/>
         <p>lover is a vision surrounded by auras. But flesh
				and blood is flesh and blood... and phlegm and
				dung and mucous and bile and etc.
				Once woman ceased to be a symbol, she
				became a person, a passion, a robber of reason
				—a literal and metaphorical scum-bag.
				No wonder the ladies were afraid to submit.
				With submission,  love and its raison d'être be-
				came the discarded backdrop for a fait accom-
				pli. The love was no longer ennobling (ergo: the
				animal soul pawed and dragged down its ration-
				al counterpart), and the woman was no longer
				mounted on a pedestal (ergo: with the man on
				top, she was mounted, period). And man’s de-
				sire—well, that often died along with his
				suffering.
				t’s natural, then, that the really legendary
				lovers chose the most distant and unattainable
				objects they couid conceive of. Guilhem de la
				Tour, for instance, loved the woman he lived
				with.6 Now such women were worn on every-
				day occasions and were inevitably mundane.
				But Guilhem’s enamorata was unearthly; in fact,
				she was dead. On the eve of her burial, Guilhem
				visited her grave and, after ten days of morbid
				embracing and poignant conversation (she was
				a good listener), he went home firm in the belief
				that she would rise from her tomb and come
				back to him. She didn't. But for years, it was
				only Beatrix he longed for. She was the perfect
				lover—mystical ethereal and unobtrusive. It
				was a passion that rivaled even Jaufre Rudel's.
				Jaufre Rudel was ingenious. In an age which
				valued prolonged desire, he contrived a won-
				derful device. He fell in love with the Countess
				of Tripoli—a woman he had never seen but
				whose beauty had filled his imagination so en-
				chantingly that southern France became a glo-
				rious vantage point. And so it remained for
				several years until, despite the protests of his
				friends and patron, he resolved at last to cross
				the ocean to be near her.
			</p>
         <p>Maybe he just got sick. Or maybe, as his
				biographers prefer to believe, the anticipation
				of seeing her was too much for his little heart to
				bear. In any case, as the boat was approaching
				Tripoli, he apparently expired. But only appar-
				ently. For as the countess rushed to his side, her
				presence revived him and he pronounced him-
				self fulfilled at last and died again in her arms—
				a self-extinction metaphorically equivalent to
				orgasm, but which Jaufre seems to have taken
				much too literally, since Petrarch and other
				chroniclers affirm that this time he actually did
				die, and in all probability with his pants on.7
				True, Jaufre was a strange and nearly legend-
				ary breed. But while to him sex must have
				seemed an unspeakable defilement, most were
				not so theoretical. Even troubadours who con-
				stantly reminded women that sex was debasing
				and honor was all had an ultimately sensua
				physicality in mind. Woman was like a fine
				wine. A man twirls it about, observes its color,
				its clarity, savoring its bouquet and rolling it
				around on his languishing taste-buds. And
				though the swallow is only the means to the
				end, the end is still very definitely in view. Most
				pleas for chastity were only lip-service. Even
				Sordello, a troubadour who repeatedly swore
				he’d rather die than see a lady even taint her
				honor, happened to kidnap a Veronese countess
				and that didn’t help her honor a bit. Nor did it
				discredit his poetry. Such scandal was irrele-
				vant. In fact, women were irrelevant. Love was
				the important thing and the trick was to keep it
				alive as long as possible, feeding it little by
				ever-so-little in an extended and delicious
				tease. Men could nudge at the gates to the
				ovarian fortress, but entrance, they knew
				should be delayed. The uitimate object was sex;
				men wanted what they waited for. They just
				didn’t want it right away. And this largely ex-
				plains why other men’s wives proved such
				suitable candidates for adoration. Forbidden,
				llicit, deliciously dangerous —yet slightly
				damaged, they promised all the more to be
				ultimately affordable. They were perfectly
				fashioned for desire
				Desire is a tricky business. In Greece Plu-
				tarch had admired Spartan marriages where, for
				years, man approached his wife in darkness in
				secret and in haste "so as not to be satiated...
				there was still place for unextinguished desire."8
				It was a useful formula and was later picked up
				in the Middle Ages when the notion of infre-
				quent and clandestine meetings was embraced
				a lot more than the ladies were. The medieval
				magic of love was uncertainty. Even the ro-
				mances preserved this ideal. The lady could
				be snatched away at any moment by a darken-
				ing scandal or a jealous husband, or be ab-
				sorbed into the ethers which spawned her dis-
				appearing into the mist on a white palfrey. The
				knight wanted her like that: distant, pure, mys-
				terious, virginal —a blonde Mary ascending into
			</p>
         <pb n="3"/>
         <p>heaven, looming over the castle horizon with
				only a little soot on her feet suggesting that she
				didn’t belong there.
				Never mind that the only pure-white creature
				was the post-menopausal albino rabbit—or that
				even the ladies depicted in romance were
				potentially swivers of heroic proportions. Since
				sex distinguished the distant fay from the dung-
				filled floozy, relatively sexless love became
				prevalent, and many women—whether they
				liked it or not—played along
				There were advantages, of course. Love be-
				came a rare delicacy whereas before it had been
				something like yesterday’s leftovers. As Ovid's
				classical formula goes: "Pleasure coming slow is
				the best”9; meaning, the longer the foreplay the
				better the orgasm; meaning, some courtly
				couples, when they finally did come, must very
				nearly have blown their brains out
				But some, for sure, were disappointed. Wom-
				en were dropped, men bumbled like Perceval or
				—like some knights in the bawdier tales—
				they'd win their ladies with lots of pomp and
				peter out before they could even open the pack-
				age, their worlds ending not with a bang but a
				whimper. These were particularly grateful for
				courtly love.
				Courtly love was a game of foreplay whose
				rule was often touch and go; it was an answet
				(and a spur) to impotence. Some knights were
				barely post-pubescent and many were sexually
				insecure, preferring rich expectations to poor
				reputations and one-night stands. Better to tilt
				about the countryside, flaunting a passion and
				flailing a sword (the sword had always been a
				metaphor for penis—"vagina” is merely Latin
				or "sheath"), imagining a truly magnificent sex-
			</p>
         <p>ual prowess when the real thing was maybe limp
				by comparison. Love by its very nature was a
				test, and knights were afraid to take the exam.
				Or sometimes, it was better to put it off than to
				put it in.
				Love became formalized. The knight waxed
				and grew pale, and waxed, and waxed, and
				waxed. It was blissful and aggrandizing antici-
				pation. Too bad if a lady sometimes felt cheat
				ed—if watching her knight charging and gleam-
				ing, she secretly wished hed get off his high
				horse and get down to business. What could the
				women do? Their iron-clad men performed in
				the tournaments. Ramming, sweating, thrusting
				and galloping. . . . Ah, those impervious men in
				the metal suits.
				...The only things naked were their swords.
