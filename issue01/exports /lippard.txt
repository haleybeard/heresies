 Lucy       R Lippard   The general alienation of contemporary avant garde artart movement    from any broad audience has been      crystallized in the women s movement  From the beginning  both liberal       feministsfem type    concerned with      changing women s personal lives and socialist feminists concerned with      overthrowing the classist racist sexist foundations of society have agreed that       fine  art is more or less irrelevant  though holding out the hope that feminist      art could and should be different  The American women artists        movement  has concentrated its efforts on gaining power within its      own interest group   the art world  in itself an incestuous network of      relationships between artists and art on the one hand and dealers publishers       buyers on the other  The  public   the  masses   or the  audience  is hardly      considered   The art world has evolved its own curious class system  Externally this is a      microcosm of capitalisttheory    society       but it maintains an internal dialectic  or just plain contradiction  that      attempts to reverse or ignore that parallel  Fame may be a higher currency than      mere money  but the two tend to go together  Since the buying and selling of art      and artists is done by the ruling classes or by those chummy with them and their      institutions  all artists or producers  no matter what their individual economic      backgrounds are dependent on the owners and forced into a proletarian role just       as women  in Engels  analysis  play proletariantheory    to the male ruler across all class       boundaries  Looking at and  appreciating  art in this century has been      understood as an instrument  or at best a result  of upward social mobility in      which owning art is the ultimate step  Making art is at the bottom of the scale       This is the only legitimate reason to see artists as so many artists see      themselves as  workers  theory  marxism         At the same time  artists maker tend to feel misunderstood and  as creators       innately superior to the buyers owners  The innermost circle of the art world      class system thereby replaces the rulers with the creators  and the contemporary      artist in the big city  read New York   is a schizophrenic      creature  S he is persistently working  up  to be accepted  not only by other      artists but also by the hierarchy that exhibits  writes about  and buys her his      work  At the same time s he is often ideologically working  down  in an attempt      to identify with the workers outside of the art context  and to overthrow the      rulers in the name of art  This conflict is augmented by the fact that most      artists are originally from the middle class  and their approach to the      bourgeoisie includes a touch of adolescent rebellion against authority  Those      few who have actually emerged from the working classtheory marxism   sometimes use this their      very lack of background privilege as privilege in itself  while playing the same      schizophrenic foreground role as their solidly middle class colleagues   Artists  then  are workers or at least producers even when they don t know it       Yet artists dressed in work clothes  or expensive imitations thereof  and      producing a commoditytheory  horkheimer and        adorno    accessible only to the rich differ drastically from      the real working class in that artists control their production and their      product or could if they realized it and if they had the strength to maintain      that control  In the studio  at least  unlike the farm  the factory  and the      mine  the unorganized worker is in superficial control and can  if s he dares       talk down to or tell off the boss   the collector  the curator  etc  For years      now  with little effect  it has been pointed out to artists that the art world      superstructure cannot run without them  Art  after all  is the product on which      all the money is made and the power based   During the 1950s and 1960s most American artists were unaware that they did not      control their art  that their art could be used not only for esthetic pleasure      or decoration or status symbols  but also as an educational weapon  In the late      1960s  between the Black  the student  the anti war and the women s       movements social movements    the facts      of the exploitation of art in and out of the art world emerged  Most artists and      artworkers still ignore these issues because they make us feel too uncomfortable      and helpless  Yet if there were a strike against museums and galleries to allow      artists control of their work  the scabs would be out immediately in full force       with reasons ranging from self interest to total lack of political awareness to      a genuine belief that society would crumble without art  that art is  above it      all   Or is it in fact below it all  as most political activists seem to      think   Another aspect of this conflict surfaces in discussions around who gets a  piece      of the pie    a phrase which has become the scornful designation for what is      actually most peoples goal   Why shouldn t artists be able to make a living in      this society like everybody else  Well  almost   everybody else        Those working for  cultural change  through political theorizing and occasional      actions are opposed to anybody getting a piece of the pie  though politics      appears to be getting fashionable again in the art world and may itself provide      a vehicle for internal success  today one can refuse a piece of the pie and      simultaneously be getting a chance at it  Still  the pie is very small and there      are a lot of hungry people circling it  Things were bad enough when only men      were allowed to take a bite  Since  aggressive women  have gotten in there too       competition  always at the heart of the art world class system  has peaked   Attendance at any large art school in the U S  takes students from all classes      and trains them for artists  schizophrenia  While being cool and chicly grubby       in the  uniform  of mass production   and knowing what s the latest in taste      and what s the kind of art to make and the right names to drop is clearly       upward mobility    from school into teaching jobs and or the art world the      lifestyle accompanying these habits is heavily weighted  downward   The working        class girl who has had to work for nice clothes must drop into frayed jeans to      make it into the art middle class  which in turn considers itself both upper and      lower class  Choosing poverty is a confusing experience for a child whose      parents  or more likely mother  have tried desperately against great odds to      keep a clean and pleasant home  Class and Feminism        ed  Charlotte Bunch and Nancy Myron  Baltimore  1974   This book contains       some excrutiating insights for the middle class feminist  it raised my       consciousness and inspired this essay  along with other recent experiences       and conversations      The artist who feels superior to the rich because s he is disguised as someone      who is poor provides a puzzle for the truly deprived  A parallel notion  rarely      admitted but pervasive  is that a person can t understand  art  if their house      is full of pink glass swans or their lawn is inhabited by gnomes and flamingos       or if they even care about house and clothes at all  This is particularly      ridiculous now  when art itself uses so much of this paraphernalia  and not      always satirically   or  from another angle  when even artists who have no      visible means of professional support live in palatial lofts and sport beat up      $100 boots while looking down on the  tourists  who come to       SoHo  to see art on Saturdays  SoHo is  in fact  the      new suburbia  One reason for such callousness is a hangover from the 1950s  when      artists really were poor and proud of being poor because their art  the argument      went  must be good if the bad guys   the rich and the masses  didn t like      it  In the 1960s the choice of poverty  often excused as anti consumerism  even      infiltrated the esthetics of art  Actually nothing       new  the history of modern art demonstrates a constant longing for the       primitive  the simple  the clear  the  poor   the noble naif  etc        First there was Pop Art  modeled on kitsch  on advertising and consumerism  and      equally successful on its own level   Women  incidentally  participated little      in Pop       Ar tLink      partly because of      its blatant sexism  sometimes presented as a parody of the image of woman in the      media   and partly because the subject matter was often  women s work   ennobled       and acceptable only when the artists were men   Then came Process Artart movement    a rebellion against the        precious object  traditionally desired and bought by the rich  Here another      kind of co optation took place  when temporary piles of dirt  oil  rags and      filthy rubber began to grace carpeted living rooms  The Italian branch was even      called Arte Povera   Then came the rise of a third stream medium called       conceptual art  which offered  anti objects  in the form of ideas books or      simple xeroxed texts and photographs with no inherent physical or monetary value        until they got on the market  that is   Conceptual artart movement    seemed politically viable because of       its notion that the use of ordinary  inexpensive  unbulky media would lead to a      kind of socialization  or at least democratization  of art as opposed to      gigantic canvases and huge chrome sculptures costing five figures and filling      the world with more consumer fetishes   Yet the trip from of on canvas to ideas on xerox was  in retrospect  yet another      instance of  downward mobility  or middle class guilt  It was no accident that      conceptual art appeared at the height of the social movements of the late 1960s      nor that the artists were sympathetic to those movements  with the qualified      exception of the women s movement   All of the esthetic tendencies listed above      were genuinely instigated as rebellions by the artists themselves  yet the fact      remains that only rich people can afford to 1  spend money on art that won t      last  2  live with  ugly art  or art that is not decorative  because the rest of      their surroundings are beautiful and comfortable  3  like  non object art  which      is only handy If you already have too many possessions when it becomes a      reactionary commentary  art for the overprivileged in a consumer society   As a child  I was accused by my parents of being an  anti snob snob  and I m      only beginning to see the limitations of such a rebellion  Years later I was an      early supporter of and proselytizer for conceptual art as escape from the      commodity orientation of the art world  a way of communicating with a broader      audience via inexpensive media  Though I was bitterly disappointed  with the      social  not the esthetic achievements  when I found that this work could be so      easily absorbed into the system  it is only now that I ve realized why the      absorption took place  Conceptual art s democratic efforts and physical vehicles      were cancelled out by its neutral  elitist content and its patronizing approach       From around 1967 to 1971  most of us involved in conceptual art saw that content      as pretty revolutionary and thought of ourselves as rebels against the cool       hostile artifacts of the prevailing formalist and minimal art  But we were so      totally enveloped in the middle class approach to everything we did and saw  we      couldn t perceive how that pseudo academic narrative piece or that      art world oriented action   in the streets was deprived of any      revolutionary content by the fact that it was usually incomprehensible and      alienating to the people  out there   no matter how fashionably downwardly      mobile it might be in the art world  The idea that if art is subversive in the      art world it will automatically appeal to a general audience now seems      absurd   The whole evolutionary basis of modernist innovation  the idea of esthetic       progress   the  I did it first  and  it s been done already  syndromes which      pervade contemporary avant garde artart        movement    and criticism  are also blatantly classist  and      have more to do with technology than with art  To be  avant garde  is inevitably      to be on top or to become upper middle class  because such innovations take      place in a context accessible only to the educated elite  Thus socially      conscious artists working in or with community groups and muralists try to      disassociate themselves from the art world  even though its values   quality        remain to haunt them personally   The value systems are different in and out of the art world  and anyone      attempting to straddle the two develops another kind of schizophrenia  For       instance  in the inner city community muralsart        movement  type     as Eva Cockcroft        points out elsewhere in this publication  the images of woman are the      traditional ones a beautiful  noble mother and housewife or worker  and a      rebellious young woman striving to change her world both of them celebrated for      their courage to be and to stay the way they are and to support their men in the      face of horrendous odds  This is not the art world or middle class  radical       view of future feminism  nor is it one which radical feminists hoping to  reach      out  across the classes can easily espouse  Here  in the realm of aspirations       is where upward and downward mobility and status quo clash  where the economic      class barriers are established  As Michele Russell       has noted  Michele Russell   Woman and Third World          New American Movement  June  1973    the Third World womanpolitical     is not attracted to the        Utopian experimentation  of the left  in the art world  the would be Marxist       avant gardeart theory     or to the       prag  matic opportunism  of the right  in the art world  those who reform and      co opt the  radicals     Many of the subjects touched on here come back to Taste  To a poor woman  art       or a beautiful object  might be defined as something she cannot have  Beauty and      art have been defined before as the desirable  In a consumer society  art too      becomes a commodity rather than a life  enhancing experience  Yet the Van       Gogh  reproduction or the pink glass swan the same beautiful      objects that may be  below  a middleclass woman  because she has  in moving      up  ward  acquired upper class taste  or would like to think she has  may be       above  or inaccessible to a welfare mother  The phrase  to dictate taste  has      its own political connotations  Minneapolis worker Interviewed by students of      artist Don Celender  said      he liked  old art works because they re more classy   Opinions of Working People Concerning the Arts  ed  Don Celender  New York        1975   and class does seem to be what the traditional notion of art is      all about  Yet contemporary avant garde art  for all its attempts to break out      of that gold frame  is equally class bound  and even the artist aware of these      contradictions in her his own life and work is hard put to resolve them  It s a      vicious circle If the artist producer is upper middle  class  and our standards      of art as taught in schools are persistently upper middle class  how do we      escape making art only for the upper middle class   The alternatives to  quality   to the  high  art shown in art world galleries      and magazines have been few  and for the most part unsatisfying  although      well intended  Even when kitschart word           politics or housework are absorbed into art  contact with the real world is not      necessarily made  At no time has the avant garde  though playing in the famous       gap between art and life   moved far enough out of the art context to attract a      broad audience that audience which has  ironically  been trained to think of art      as something that has nothing to do with life and  at the same time  tends only      to like that art which means something in terms of its own life  or fantasies       The dilemma for the leftist artist in the middle class is that her his standards      seem to have been set irremediably  No matter how much we know about what the      broader public wants  or needs  it is very difficult to break social      conditioning and cultural habits  Hopefully  a truly feminist art will provide      other standards   To understand the woman artist s position in this complex situation between the      art world and the real world  class and gender  it is necessary to know that in      America artists are rarely respected unless they are stars or rich or mad or      dead  Being an artist is not being  somebody   Middle class families are happy      to pay lip service to art but god forbid their own children take it so seriously      as to consider it a profession  Thus a man who becomes an artist is asked when      he is going to  go to work   and he is not  so covertly considered a child  a      sissy  a woman   someone who has a hobby rather than a vocation  someone who      can t make money and therefore cannot hold his head up in the real world of      men at least until his work sells  at which point he may be welcomed back  Male      artists  bending over backward to rid themselves of this stigma  tend to be      particularly susceptible to insecurity and machismo  So women daring to insist      on their place in the primary rank as art makers rather than as art housekeepers       curators  critics  dealers   patrons   inherit a heavy burden of male fears in      addition to the economic and psychological   discrimination still      rampant in a patriarchal  money oriented society   Most art being shown now has little to do with any woman s experience  in part      because women rich ones as  patrons   others as decorators and  home makers        are in charge of the private sphere  while men identify more easily with public      art art that has become public through economic validation  the million dollar        Rembrandt    Private artart       type    is often seen as mere ornament  public artart type    is associated with monuments and       money  with  high  art and its containers  including unwelcoming whitewalled      galleries and museums with classical courthouse architecture  Even the graffiti       artistsart style     whose work was      unsuccessfully transferred from subways to art galleries  were all men       concerned with facades  with having their names in spray paint  in lights  in      museums     Private art is visible only to intimates  I suspect the reason so few women        folk  artistsart type    work outdoors in       large scale  like Simon       Rodia  s Watts Towers  and      other  naives and visionaries  with their cement and bottles  is not only      because men aspire to erections and know how to use the necessary tools  but      because women can and must assuage these same creative urges inside the house       with the pink glass swan as an element in their own works of art the living room      or kitchen  In the art world the situation is doubly paralleled  Women s art      until recently was rarely seen in public and all artists are voluntarily  women       because of the social attitudes mentioned above  the art world is so small that      it is  private    Just as the living room is enclosed by the building it is in  art and artist are      firmly imprisoned by the culture which supports them  Artists claiming to work      for themselves alone  and not for any audience at all  are passively accepting      the upper middle class audience of the internal art world  This is compounded by      the fact that to be middle class is to be passive  to live with the expectation      of being taken care of and entertained  But art should be a      consciousness raiser  it partakes of and should fuse the private and the public      spheres  It should be able to reintegrate the personal without being satisfied      by the merely personal  One good test is whether or not it communicates  and      then  of course  what and how it communicates  If it doesn t communicate it may      just not be very good art from anyone s point of view  or it may be that the      artist is not even aware of the needs of others  or simply doesn t care   For there is a need out there  a need vaguely satisfied at the moment by        schlock   Bernard Kirchenbaum  in correspondence        Celender  op  cit   offers proof of this need and of the huge  and amazing        interest in art expressed by the working class  though it should be said       that much of what is called art would not be agreed upon by the taste       dictators   And it seems that one of the basic tenets of the feminist      arts should be a reaching out from the private sphere to transform that       artificial art  and to more fully satisfy that need  For the art world artist      has come to consider her his private needs paramount  and has too often      forgotten about those of the audience  any audience  Work that communicates to a      dangerous number of people is derogatorily called a  crowd pleaser   This is a      blatantly classist attitude  taking for granted that most people are by nature      incapable of understanding good art  ie   upper class or quality art   At the      same time  much ado is made about art educational theories that claim to  teach      people to see   consider the political implications of this notion  and muffle      all issues by stressing the  universality  of great art   It may be that at the moment the possibilities are slim for a middle class art      world s understanding or criticism of the little art we see that reflects      working class cultural values  Perhaps our current responsibility lies in      humanizing our own activities so that they will communicate more effectively      with all women  Hopefully we will aspire to more than women s art flooding the      museum and gallery circuit  Perhaps a feminist art will only emerge when we      become wholly responsible for our own work  for what becomes of it  who sees it       and who is nourished by it  For a feminist artist  whatever her style  the prime      audience at this time is other women  So far  we have tended to be satisfied      with communicating with those women whose social experience is close to ours       This is natural enough  since this is where we will get our greatest support       and we need support in taking this risk of trying to please women  knowing that      we are almost certain to displease men in the process  In addition  it is       embarrassing to talk openly about the class systemsystemic structures    which divides us  hard to do so       without sounding more bourgeois than ever in the implications of superiority and      inferiority inherent in such discussions  where the working class is as often      considered superior as the middle class    A book of essays called Class and Feminism  written by       The Furies   a lesbian feminist collective  makes clear      that from the point of view of working class women  class is a definite problem      within the women s movement  As Nancy Myron  observes       middle class women  can intellectualize  politicize  accuse  abuse and       contribute money in order not to deal with their own classism  Even if they       admit that class exists  they are not likely to admit that their behavior is       a product of it  They will go through every painful detail of their lives to       prove to me or another working class woman that they really didn t have any       privilege  that their family was exceptional  that they actually did have an       uncle who worked in a factory  To ease anyone s guilt is not the point of       talking about class    You don t get rid of oppression just by talking about       it     Women are more strenuously conditioned toward upward cultural mobility or       gentility  than men  which often results in the woman consciously betraying her      class origins as a matter of course  The hierarchies within the whole span of      the middle class are most easily demarcated by lifestyle and dress  For      instance  the much scorned  Queens housewife stereotype      may have enough to eat  may have      learned to consume the unnecessities  and may have made it to a desired social      bracket in her community  but if she ventures to make art  not just own it   she      will find herself back at the bottom in the art world  looking wistfully up to      the plateau where the male  the young  the bejeaned seem so at ease   For middle class women in the art world not only dress  down   but dress like      working class men  They do so because housedresses  pedal pushers  polyester      pantsuits  perrnanents  the wrong accents are not such acceptable disguises for      women as the boots  overalls and win breaker syndromes are for men  Thus young      middle class women tend to deny their female counterparts and take on  male        unisex  attire  It may at times have been chic to dress like a native       Americanidentities    or a Bedouin       womanidentities      but it has never      been chic to dress like a working class woman  even if she s trying to look like       Jackie Kennedy        Young working class women  and men  spend a large amount of avallable money on      clothes  it s a way to forget the rats and roaches by which even the cleanest      tenement dwellers are blessed  or the mortgages by which even the      hardest working homeowners are blessed  and to present a classy facade  Artists      dressing and talking  down  insult the hardhat much as rich kids in rags do       they insult people whose notion of art is something to work for the pink glass      swan   Yet women  as evidenced by the Furies  publication  and as pointed out elsewhere       most notably by Bebel    have a unique chance to      communicate with women across the boundaries of economic class because as a       vertical class  we share the majority of our most fundamental      experiences emotionally  even when economically we are divided  Thus an economic      analysis does not adequately explore the psychological and esthetic      ramifications of the need for change within a sexually oppressed group  Nor does      it take into consideration that women s needs are different from men s or so it      seems at this still unequal point in history  The vertical class cuts across the      horizontal economic classes in a column of injustices  While heightened class      consciousness can only clarify the way we see the world  and all clarification      is for the better  I can t bring myself to trust hard lines and categories where      fledgling feminism is concerned   Even in the art world  the issue of feminism has barely been raised in mixed      political groups  In 1970  women took our rage and our energies to our own      organizations  or directly to the public by means of picketing and protests       While a few men supported these  and most politically conscious male artists now      claim to be feminists to some degree  the political and apolitical art world      goes on as though feminism didn t exist the presence of a few vociferous      feminist artists and critics not withstanding  And in the art world  as in the      real world  political commitment frequently means total disregard for feminist      priorities  Even the increasingly Marxist group ironically calling itself       Art  Language  is unwilling to stop the exclusive use of      the male pronoun in its theoretical publications  This       despite their publication of and apparent endorsement of Carolee       Schneemann s  The Prounoun Tyranny  in the Fox  3 1976    Experiences like this one and dissatisfaction with Marxismtheory  marxism    s lack of interest in  the woman      question  make me wary of merging Marxism and feminism  The notion of the      non economic or  vertical  class is anathema to Marxists and confusion is      rampant around the chicken egg question of whether women can be equal before      the establishment of a classless society or whether a classless society can be      established before women are liberated  As Sheila Rowbotham       says of her own Marxism and feminism  They are at once incompatible and       in real need of one another  As a feminist and a Marxist I carry their       contradictions within me and it is tempting to opt for one or the other in       an effort to produce a tidy resolution of the commotion generated by the       antagonism between them  But to do that would mean evading the social       reality which gives rise to the antagonism  Sheila        Rowbotham  Women  Resistance and Revolution  London        1972     As women  therefore  we need to establish far more strongly our own sense of      community  so that all our arts will be enjoyed by all women in all economic      circumstances  This will happen only when women artists make conscious ef        forts to cross class barriers  to consider their audience  to see  respect  work      with the women who create outside the art world whether in suburban crafts      guilds or in offices and factories or in community workshops  The current      feminist passion for women s traditional arts  which influences a great many      women artists  should make this road much easier  undess it too becomes      another commercialized rip off  Despite the very real class obstacles  I feel      strongly that women are in a privileged position to satisfy the goal of an art      which would communicate the needs of all classes and sexes to each other  and      get rid ofthe we they dichotomy to as great an extent as is possible in a      capitalist framework  Our sex  our oppression and our female experience our      female culture  just being explored   offer access to all of us by these common      threads    Lucy R  Lippard is a feminist art critic  writes fiction too  and has been active     politically  She is co founder of several women artists  groups and has published 10     books on contemporary art  the two most recent ones being From the Center       Feminist Essays on Women s Art   E P  Dutton  and Eva      Hesse   N Y U  Press
