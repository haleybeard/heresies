 Joan Braderman  In this essay  I would like to suggest where feminism can lead us and what myths must             finally be left behind to get there  The nature of these myths the myths of equality              individualism and democratic liberalism which underwrite our humanist heritage  account             for the weakest elements of feminist ideology  The recognition that feminism is an             ideology  like Marx  s recognition that humanism is an ideology  i e   not a             discourse whose  truth  was inseparable from the world it described  is a necessary step             in re examining what feminism is and what it can do    I will use as a conceit the form of  the contradiction  that underlying  dynamic             mechanism of history in a way that is sometimes more metaphorical than concrete  I take             the liberty of using this model rhetorically at times to begin to establish a series of             interrelationships between ideologies and their culture  I use it to suggest the many             ways the several spheres of interest to Heresies readers art  feminism and their             political context are subject to a set of analogous and mutually reinforcing ideologi              cal myths  Most feminists and artists alike are still held captive by the power of these             seduc  tive belief systems  although they threaten the coherence of our arguments              threaten our inter  ests and threaten the very survival of the ideal of freedom   A confrontation between the facts and fictions which surround us becomes inevitable             within an escalating spiral of contradictions  The first group to experience directly             the essen  tial contradictions of the society we live in is  of course  the lowest             class  the unemployed  the poorest  least skilled  most exploited working people  Next              the marginal groups  in North America  people of color  immigrants  the elderly  etc              Artists are marginal too  They feel the economic squeeze in recessions  may even become             politicized as a result  And across all these groups are women  As groups  then  women             and artists have a low priority in the hierarchy of capital   To give up the humanist myths  those most cherished ideals of our own class  the             bourgeoisie  which were forged when it was the revolutionary class  is difficult indeed              But give them up we must  for in the face of heightening contradictions economic              biological  ideological  we have no choice   By 1976  the women s movement seems to have nearly as many political lines as there are             women in it  This partly healthy  partly disturbing fact reflects with painful clarity             both the strengths and implicit weaknesses of the feminist critique of society  What is             feminist practice  What is it to be a feminist in 1976  Is it to be an individual woman              making it  in a man s world  Is it to recognize woman s historical oppression and              released from individual frustration and guilt  to take on collective responsibility              What is the nature of such a responsibility  Is it restricted to oneself  To oneself and             the women one sees every week  Is this a responsibility to oneself  to women  to men  to             history  In short  is feminism  as an ideology  fundamentally dangerous to the sexism it             despises  If so  how   To many women  enmeshed in the growing contradictions of late capitalist society              feminism  by 1976  has proven as much a trap as a liberation  What seemed to so many of             us as little as five years ago a potentially revolutionary force now appears to be             virtually co opted  The great capitalist commodity machine has produced a whole new             catalogue of cultural commodities  the feminist writer  artist  poet  the teminist             academic  professional  journalist  TV persona  the feminist token with that  feminist             mystique   She is for sale in the cul  tural marketplace  She is tough  durable              tire ess  She is  sexually liberated   a great lay   She works harder than a man  She             has to  She is still a woman in a world that calls people  mankind   That is   equality              for women still equals inequality for women  This is a contradiction   What kind of contradiction  It is a contradiction between the ideology of bourgeois             feminism and economic and biological fact  The economic facts of life for the great             majority of women remain the same  unpaid domestic labor  ill paid labor in the work             force  Biological fact  which is gender difference along with its cultural baggage              proposes a contradiction  even for those of us who are female tokens of one sort or             another  who are members of the bourgeoisie   Our psychosexual behavior  like our economic roles  is wholly determined by an             inherited system of power relations  not only in the public sector  but at deeper             levels  in the formation within the family of the psyche itself  Hence  as Juliet                Mitchell  so carefully   describes  Mitchell  Juliet    Women and Equality    in Partisan                   Review   Summer  1975   it is the concept of equality which is             invalid within our system  The abstract ideal of equality  she demonstrates  provides             the philosophical basis for our laws  Our legal system  at its best  functions as if             each of its individual constituents were equal  If some people have only their labor to             sell  and this labor produces more value than it returns to the laborer an unequal             exchange has taken place  The laborer  then  and the owner of the means to produce that              surplus value  are not equal  If some people are denied  by virtue of their color              access even to the skills of labor  to whom are they equal  If half of all people have             babies and half do not  are they all  equal   Logical incompatabilities arise  what is             different is not the same  and gender  among other things  means difference   Radical feminism has tried to take on this contradiction indeed proclaimed it the             essential contradiction in our form of social organization  Between biology and destiny              it proposes  stands consciousness  Woman s oppression vertically crosses class lines              crosses race lines  women  armed with  consciousness  would speak to each other across a             history of divisions and change the world  Women s groups would not only clarify the             areas of shared experience which foster that consciousness  but would serve as support             communities  With sisterhood for strength  women would hit male supremacy where it             lived  at home  Yet what  after all  has changed  The quality of life for a few             privileged women  a small step  Was all that fervor  sisterhood and revolutionary             idealism that was meant to reinvent the terms for a mass movement so easily engorged              packaged and recycled   For radical feminism too has been partially co opted  Since it had already dropped out             of the broader  sexist  political arena  it provided support systems for women  but             toward an uncertain end  Seeing few alternatives and tantalized by a taste of power             women often used that strength to re enter the dominant culture to become as             competitive  as  good  as men  Has the women s movement had so little concrete impact on             most women s lives   Certainly the patriarchy was sufficiently threatened to let the feminist token into the             limelight   Why co opt without advertising the co opted product   But she did not make             it into the statistics  The economic facts so far as most women are concerned remain             unchanged  unpaid domestic labor  ill paid labor in the work force  The wage             differential between men and women in fact is now greater than it was ten years ago              Even the hard won victory of abortion  for a price   even the possibility of  equal             rights  before the very laws which uphold a system of inequality  are a slap in the face             to an ideology which aimed to alter the very  nature  of human relationships  This too             is a contradiction   What kind of contradiction  It is a contradiction between an ideology and a system  an             ideology which has placed its profoundly hu  manist hope in individual consciousness as             somehow separable from the structures in which that consciousness is created              Demystifying the contradictory elements of traditional feminism itself  then  is part of             our task  In capitalist society  the process through which human labor is translated             into commodity  then capital  is a process necessarily affecting not only the pro              duction of tractors and bombs but the production of ideology  This process puts             intellectual labor like esthetic labor  like factory labor like reproductive labor in             the service of a system which generates a surplus of wealth for the few and subsistence             for the many  This contradiction  between the forces of production  labor  and the             property relations of production  own  ership  is the contradiction which Marxists  claim moves history  because it produces class struggle  the             power of masses of people to labor becomes the power to revolt   This contradiction has moved history  But  feminists ask  has it altered the basic             relation between woman and man  woman and childrearing  woman and psychosexual slavery              For the hypocrisy of bourgeois ideology in relation to bourgeois practice is             paradigmatic within the structure of the family  Marriage  ostensibly a contractual             agreement between consenting equals  is in fact a property relation between an owner and             an exploited  isolated and powerless worker   It is the belief in the illusion that such social contracts can be fulfilled that has             hung feminists on the horns of contradiction  Feminism was born in the 17th century             along with the concept of equality of individuals  It was as Sheila                Rowbotham  has documented  Rowbotham  Sheila                     Women  Resistance and                   Revolution   Vintage Books   New York                 1974    heated in the cauldron of bourgeois revolution and simmered in the             idealism of 19th century Utopianism à la Fourier  who             claimed that  the change in historical epoch can always be determined by the progress of             women toward freedom   Ibid   p  51  Bourgeois feminism has begun  then  in its history of leaps and starts to identify and             attack its sexist enemy  and taken a few long strides away from female feudalism for the             benefit of some bourgeois women  But the heart of the problem remains  Feminists from                Tennessee Claflin  to idk who this                is Isadora Duncan  have scored high in locating             it   At the ballot box is not where the shoe pinches  It is at home where the husband is             the supreme ruler that the little difficulty arises  he will not surrender this absolute             power unless he is compelled   wrote Claflin in 1871  Schneir                    Miriam   ed   Feminism  The Essential Historical                   Writings   Vintage Books   New York   1972   p  xviii   Duncan  in her             1927 autobiography said   Any intelligent woman who reads the marriage contract and then             goes into it  deserves all the consequences   Ibid   p                 XV   Here is the confounding point  Monogamy asserts a situation in which one             individual  owns  another  It is not ownership   per se that is in question             now  but again  the mystification of what the individual is and can control  In             participating in the compromised  equality  of marriage  each individual agrees to             propagate the species in the context of the values of patriarchy  Values are learned              sex  uality is formed  ideology is maintained within the family   When feminists claim that  the personal is politicalpersonal                   is political    they refer in a sense  to this problem  Their             hypothesis is that one can generalize from the individual  internal dynamics of sexist             oppression  to a general rule  Freud  s revelation             of the structures of the unconscious confirms to an extent the validity of that             enterprise  But up to now feminists have not taken it far enough  Having accepted the             existence of subconscious structural analogues which mirror the differences between the             sexes in the world  we can now proceed with the knowledge that  as a group  we are bound             not only by the manifest political forms of our oppression but by these internal psychic             monsters  In attempting to combat these monsters  however  feminists have often mistaken             the cart for the horse  The personal is political but with few exceptions  this             invocation has simply generated a longer list of symptoms of the sexist disease  We must             locate the causes of this disease if we are ever to cure it  We must exploit Freud s             science of the mind  but only insofar as it is conjoined with the science of history              that is to say out of the context of individualism   Sisterhood is really powerful only insofar as it is armed with a coherent theory and a             mass strategy  We are in and of our culture  so is the feminist ideal  We must pursue              with maximum scientific rigor  the vanguard theories of culture which culture has             produced  We must use the best available tools to locate the incoherence  the             contradictions in extant phallocentric models and generate predictive models based in             the experience of both halves of the human race  Feminists who wish to throw Freud out             the window because of simplistic readings of  penis envy  current in popular psychology             might well take a look at Mitchell s Feminism and                Psychoanalysis  for a re examination of the usefulness of psychoanalysis to             feminist analysis  Her ef  fort there is exemplary  We cannot just look back             nostalgically to ancient matriarchies  Indeed  fantasies about matriarchy in our era are             pure science fiction  But their existence does suggest that alternate models for culture             can exist   Recent controversy over Mitchell s book  among feminists and male psychoanalytic             theorists here and abroad  suggests the  hotness  of this issue  Interestingly  this             relation of sexuality to political economy is also being strongly developed outside a             feminist context  most prominently on a major intellectual front in the tradition of             French structuralism  European feminists  especially in England and France  have thus             been drawn to that tradition as heightened contradictions impel them to seek out means             for their resolution  The main tendency in this area is necessarily phallocentric  it is             still being written largely through the cipher of a male experience of the world  But if             we as women don t begin to write ourselves into history  who will  For so far  compared             to the scope of the theoretical  strategic and practical task ahead  the  woman             question  has really only been given lip service by the most advanced intellectual             sciences  not surprising since they are  man made   Engels   Marx and others have  of course  identified the monogamous              patriarchal family as the central prison for woman  Mechanistic Marxists therefore claim             that releasing her from this singular prison into the work force  under socialism  must             guarantee her freedom  Does it  Has it   Not significantly  not yet  The major 20th century socialist revolutions have made some             progress  removing  as in China  the most barbaric manifestations of sexist domination              Immediately following the Soviet revolution  Lenin  s program             included not only the training of women to join the work force at all levels  but the             legalization of abortion  free  accessible divorce  communal daycare  etc  Within ten             years  however Stalin ist backlash hit these family issues hardest  much harder              predictably  than the building of an extra domestic women s work force  In China  with             the Cultural Revolution and before  ideological struggle against the values of             patriarchy has at least begun  But in the U S S R    in the context of             their drive to quickly meet economic priorites which created the bastard known as  state             capitalism   it was easier to fall back on the ingrained behaviors of the traditional             family unit for free work by women in the home   The American Communist Party  reflects this tendency  still defending the              fighting family unit  as a revolutionary force in America  a reactionary notion  In             fact  mothers have been strong revolutionaries  The strength of the women of Vietnam in             the long battle to defeat American imperialism is a case in point  But  as in Algeria              where fighting European imperialism also meant the reassertion of the heavily             patriarchal values of Arab and Islamic culture  women s fate has most often been  off             the battlefield and back to the kitchen  The contradictions of the double standard             apparently are so heightened during periods of revolution that  as with Bolsheviks  like Alexandra Kollontai   the             preaching and practice of  free love   and all it implies  becomes acceptable  for a             brief time  Despite Lenin s great sympathy and work for women  his Victorianism  won out in the area of sex  Even the Soviet woman engineer             comes home to work that is still hers  and still never   done   In the U S   too  anti feminist backlash  somewhat reminiscent of the Stalinist attack             on women s freedom  splits American feminism down its uncertain center  Though             reformists suggest that there is room in a liberal America to heal the wounds of women              liberalism is particularly dangerous since it cleverly masks its own conservatism  its             own investment in the status quo  Liberal ideology neatly instantiates the two part form             of the contradiction   Its progressive side provides a rationale for defending the             rights of individuals against the state  Its reactionary side emphasized that capitalism             is not a system where one class exploits another but is rather a collection of             individuals  any one of whom can succeed if he or she so decides  Guettel                    Charnie   Marxism and Feminism    Women s                   Educational Press   Ontario   Canada  1974   p  2    I hope it is becoming clear how ideologically messy liberalism really is from a             post humanist perspective in which the individual can no longer be seen as the subject             of history  Liberalism is seen by leftists as a joke because it bears so tenuously the             wan hopes of a bankrupt humanism and is ultimately  untenable  Even hardcore             conservatism is more internally coherent  Conservatives and Marxists alike might             describe capitalism as a system in which the  stronger  individuals make out  The             difference  of course  is that conservatives say so approvingly  grounding their             argument in the old dog eat dog theory of what they call human nature  Marxists have             favored the idea that the industrial capitalist system tends to pervert or alienate what             is potentially  or at a given historical moment  good  in human beings  Stated so             simply  both are inadequate readings but at least they rehearse the consistency of these             positions   The liberal wants to enjoy the fruits of his class privilege while salving his guilty             conscience with a quasi philosophic posture proposing that every individual  being             protected by  equality  before the law  by  equal  opportunity measures  etc   could             theoretically be enjoying this same privilege if he or she were as hard  working and             dauntless as him herself  Thus the liberal buys off with a little charity or minimal             social welfare all those who  by some extreme individual misfortune  can t quite cut             it  Here we return to the underbelly of co optation  While a bill assuring equal          rights before unequal laws is flung in our faces  and even defeated  adding insult to          injury   the dominant media simultaneously declare the women s movement to be  over  or          somehow  won  because of the presence of one and a half news anchor women on TV or the          financial viability of Ms                 Magazine     Capitalist propaganda demonstrates before our eyes          that by inference  if one woman can do work that one man can do  women are the achieved           equals  of men  The responsibility for change is thus cleverly switched back onto the          shoulders of individual  women  to change the world  all you really must do is          change yourself  And the mapping of contradictions comes full circle   The liberal             feminist  like the liberal social democrat  learns to sate herself on the token goodies             she is tendered  Or the radical feminist  who  lacking a viable mass strategy  is a             liberal in disguise  tries to build a separatist island on which she and her sisters can             be  free   It s a dilemma  I was  and in some ways still am  such a radical feminist              After all  I am a member of the women s group which publishes this magazine  We try to             experiment with anti oligarchic forms  collective practice  But what is an egalitarian             island in a sea of capitalist contradictions but something doomed  as it were  to             sinking   Witness a little linguistic contradiction and the issues it raises for us in Heresies              We are constituted as a collective  Adopting one of the stronger aspects of feminist             practice  we attempt to chip away at the hierarchical authority structures of The                Systemthe system   on a micro level by             attempting to produce a theoretical magazine on a collective basis  The assumption here             is that theory and practice must develop together in a dialectical relationship  But in             order to function as a legal entity  we are transformed to Heresies Collective  Inc   an             incorporated collective  This is either redundant or ironic  The fact is  we don t even             aspire to making profits but are completely dependent on the legal and business             structures around us  This dependence relation  the impossibility of autonomy within a given economic             structure  has meant about a two year life span for most American collectives before us              according to popular lore  This dependence also means that artists  par  ticularly those             artists being forced by heightened economic contradictions to face political realities              must re examine their place in our culture  The feminist filmmaker for example  has had             to confront this issue head on  Film  more than any other artform  requires the mas              tery of machine technology  For women  that technology and the authority it connotes has             been historically taboo  There are exceptions in the history of film I and others have written elsewhere about the history of women                directors  See my article in Artforum     Sept                 1972  and Sharon                   Smith  s Women Who Make Movies                      Hopkinson and Black   New York  1975    but the percentage             of women filmmakers is dramatically low for a 20th  century art  Feminists with the             energy and support of their sisters in the movement have begun to break that taboo  But             in doing so  they have been thrown against a major contradiction facing all              independent  filmmakers  the problem of capital  For to make films requires large             amounts of capital  capital which is controlled by the ruling classes  middle class             liberals included   Advocates of independent filmmaking from Maya Deren  in the 1940s              implicitly  to Annette                Michelson  in the 1960s  explicitly in her article  Film and the                Radical Aspiration     In Film Culture                   Reader    ed   P  Adams Sitney                      Praeger    New York  1970    have proposed that a stance             outside of the commercial market is itself a  political  gesture  It is to the   extent that money can be garnered from liberals to make  art  as long as it             is not fundamentally dangerous  But can any political art which attempts to attack the             assumptions of The System from within patriarchal capitalism actually threaten it  This             has been and will be an area of debate for many political estheticians and ar  tists and             can hardly be answered here   But we can and must confront the question  From what is the  independent  filmmaker or             artist independent  She is not independent from the need to make a living  She is not             independent from the need for capital money which gives the power to make her films and             distribute her films within a tight commercial media monopoly  When a feminist wonders             why capitalists won t hand over the money to make antisexist films  she  like her              independent  male counterpart  must face the terms of her depend  ence  She has begun             to beg  borrow or steal  translated as win grants  go into debt  etc   the capital to             write herself into visual history  making films about the experience of women  viz  the             films of Julia Reichert    Yvonne Rainer    Barbara                Kopple    Chantal Ackerman    and many             others  But who actually sees these films  They are shown in women s festivals  in             avant garde and political forums in a few major cities  She is  in short  caught in that             same economic trap  Cooperatives for pooling resources and sharing distribution efforts              such as New                Day Films   are beginning to form  they are collectives like Heresies  But             the absolute dependence on the inconsistent  discrimate charity of liberals is the             underside of that ultimately romantic hope for  independence   The terms for             independence  then  among artists and feminists  are the very terms of dependence  Yet             another contradiction   I would like to convince all feminists that it is time to realign with the Left              Current economic realities  heightening contradictions  and the topography of world             imperialism reaching its limits  are forcing many groups in America to confront their             need for unity  The traditionally sectarian American Left itself is beginning to move             toward coalition and alliance  toward unity across color lines  across race lines              across class lines and  across gender lines  Within such a potential             configuration women could speak to other women  We are beginning to recognize that all             oppressed peoples within capitalism must come together if we are even to begin to be             able to defend ourselves against the attacks and backlash of this system  much less to             build a new one   Several feminist strategies for such a realignment of women with the broader struggle             for freedom are presented in this issue of Heresies  see  Toward                Socialist Feminism   and  Wages for Housework     This             does not mean that women will not have to continue to force the priority of their own             demands in relation to the needs of others  Women will need autonomy to develop theory             and strategy accountable to our own needs within a broad movement  to avoid the failures             of socialist experiments in the past  Thus  we must make our fight in the context of a             movement we help to define and build  a movement that can take on the class             contradiction as well as the racial and sexual contradictions implicit in the structures             of the larger society  For  on these structures  the fate of all women  like it or not              is inextricably dependent  To wed feminism to the myths and false hopes of liberal             idealism is to contribute to the systematic liquidation of its
