      <p>Women's role in the community mural movement is much greater than is generally recognized.
         Major city-sponsored mural programs in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q100">Boston</a> (<a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/36150536/">Adele Seronde</a> and <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109320582">Summerthing</a>), <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60">New York</a>
         				(<span style="font-style:italic">Susan Shapiro-Kiok</span> and <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56291068">Cityarts</a>), and <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q65">Los Angeles</a> (<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6304327">Judy Baca</a> and <span style="font-style:italic">Citywide</span>) have been initiated and directed by women artists, who have given these programs
         much of their character
         				and philosophy. Women have led school mural projects, mural collectives, and mural-work
         with street youth. Whether working as individual muralists, members of coalitions,
         or in
         				collectives, women have increasingly dominated the mural movement as a force for
         non-elitismI think this is essential to the progress of an organization, especially
         one with human rights and justice at the center. One cannot make change while reproducing
         hierarchy and power dynamics, collectivity, and the practice of social philosophies
         ranging from humanism to
         				Marxism.</p>
      <p>Murals on urban walls reflecting the aspirations of neighborhood residents began as
         part of the more general social upheaval of the 1960s. Artists found themselves dragged
         into the
         				social arena and forced to consider questions beyond those of pure form. By the
         late 1960s they could no longer avoid confronting questions concerning the relevance,
         audience, and
         				uses of their art. A number of movements arose that tried to enlarge the audience
         and scope of contemporary art. Minority-group and politically active artists felt
         both a demand and
         				an opportunity to create an art responsive to their special heritage and relevant
         to their own ethnic group, community, or movement. Mainstream artists attempted to
         bring art out
         				of the museums and into the cities in the form of urban super-graphics, environmental
         sculptures, streetworks, and happenings. Out of the coincidence of these social and
         artistic
         				forces the community mural movement began in 1967-68.</p>
      <p>The mural movement took on different forms in different locations, depending on which
         particular combination of social forces spurred its beginnings. The first mural in
         <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1297">Chicago</a>, the
         
         				1967<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29641568">Wall of Respect</a>, was painted by 21 Black artists from the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7101960">Organization of Black American Culture</a> (OBAC) and celebrated Black history and culture. It was a political-art
         				happening involving musicians and poets who played and read as the painting progressed.
         Although women artists participated in the Wall of Respect, they were not among those
         who
         				continued the movement in Chicago and went from the OBAC wall to paint in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12439">Detroit</a>. </p>
      <p>For a long time <span style="font-style:italic">Vanita Green</span>'s Black Women (1970) served as the token of women's participation in the Chicago mural movement.
         Green was 17, a high school dropout, when she saw <span style="font-style:italic">William Walker</span> painting the Peace and Salvation Wall of Understanding near the Cabrini-Green projects where she lived. After watching for a time, she asked
         Walker for paints and brushes and
         				on a storage shed nearby painted portraits of famous Black women from Aunt Jemima
         to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q160456">Angela Davis</a>. Almost immediately afterwards, the wall was defaced with large splashes of white
         				paint, practically the only defacement in Chicago up to that time. When Green
         saw what the vandals had done, she commented, "Before, it was just a pretty picture,
         but it says more
         				now." In general, though, during those early years women found their place largely
         as assistants and apprentices in one of the two major community-based Chicago mural
         groups: <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/134009800/">Public
            				Art Workshop</a>, led by <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/43387406/">Mark Rogovin</a>, and <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/139809031/">Chicago Mural Group</a>, a multi-ethnic coalition led by William Walker and <a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/ulan/500070127">John Weber.</a></p>
      <p>In <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q100">Boston</a>, on the other hand, women played an important role in introducing the mural idea.
         Boston artist Adele Seronde’s proposal calling for the use of neglected city sites
         to
         				transform the city into a museum was the start. Through the collaboration of <span style="font-style:italic">Kathy Kane</span> of the Mayor's Office of Cultural Affairs, the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3152226">Institute of Contemporary Art</a>, a number of
         				Black artists, and Seronde, Summerthing was launched. It was the largest and most
         productive of the early mural programs, beginning in 1968 and peaking in 1970. The Summerthing program
         				combined elements of three distinct phenomena which had emerged the preceding
         year—the renaissance in Black culture (Wall of Respect), the "Summer in the City Paint-in
         Festival" and
         				various clean-up programs, and the desire of environmental artists to work in
         urban spaces. Summerthing sponsored Black Power murals, children's playground and
         pocket-park
         				projects, and decorative walls—all within a framework allowing for neighborhood
         control. Under Seronde's direction, the program emphasized the sociological rather
         than the
         				decorative aspect of public art. Many impressive walls were painted from 1968
         to 1970, especially in the Black communities of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20138">Roxbury</a> and South End–including the first women's wall,
         
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q107551786">Sharon Dunn</a>'s Black Women, painted in 1970. Seronde is only one of many women who  have made important contributions as organizers and administrators. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6304327">Judy Baca</a>, a
         				leading Chicana muralist in Los Angeles, obtained City funding for a similar neighborhood-oriented
         large-scale mural program (Citywide Murals) in 1974. <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/45550073/">Shelly Killen</a> heads a program
         				for murals in prisons in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1387">Rhode Island</a>, which has operated in the correctional institutions there for the past two years.
         <span style="font-style:italic">Sandy Rubin</span>'s Alternate Graffiti Workshop in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philadelphia">Philadephia</a>
         				pioneered techniques for developing the artistic potential of graffiti writers;
         several of her workshop graduates have become muralists in their own right. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7382874">Ruth Asawa</a> and <span style="font-style:italic">Nancy Thompson</span> developed the Alvarado School-Community Program in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q62">San Francisco</a> which brings community artists into the public schools to enrich the school experience
         and has heped to
         				open the doors to "Artists in the Schools" programs around the country. In fact,
         at the present time, the majority of the mural programs throughout the nation are
         directed by
         				women. </p>
      <p>The major influx of women artists into the mural movement did not take place until
         1971-73 when news about the community walls had become better known outside the actual mural
         				communities. This was also a time of expansion for the <span style="font-style:italic">Womens Liberation Movement</span>. Many women artists tried mural work, but not all of them became muralists. Community
         mural work,
         				although highly rewarding, requires a certain kind of openness and great dedication.
         It also demands physical labor, community organizing, going to meetings, and an ability
         to deal
         				with the great variety of people who come up to talk or make comments. However,
         a number of the women who did become involved in the eanly 1970s now identify themselves
         as muralists and are recognized for their artistic contributions. </p>
      <p>The development of <span style="font-style:italic">Caryl Yasko</span> one of the best muralists in the nation and a leader of the <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/139809031/">Chicago Mural Group</a>, illustrates this process. like Green, Yasko was introduced to the mural
         				movement through William Waker when she volunteered as a parent-assistant for
         a mural he was directing with children at her neighborhood school. After this experience,
         Yasko and her
         				partner in a small art enterprise, <span style="font-style:italic">Kathy judge</span>, a ceramicist, worked with small children to paint Walls of Hope. Vasko and judge were then invited to join the Chicago Mural Group. In
         				the summer of 1972, Yasko directed her first major project, Under City Stone, a mural that runs throughout the 55th Street underpass in Hyde Park. Painted from
         Yasko's design with the
         				help of a team recruited from passers-by, it shows hundreds of figures walking
         around and, above them, the machinery, technology, and pollution of today's city.
         Yasko painted herself
         				in the 
         				 crowd—a slim young woman, paintbrushes in hand, a baby on her back.
         				The following year Yasko painted in the heart of the Black-Belt South Side with
         a team of young Black people. Located on a prenatal clinic wall, this mural depicts
         statuesque,
         				larger-than-life women with their children. In 1974 Yasko broke new ground for
         the Chicago muralists. Although murals had become commonplace in many areas of Chicago
         certain white
         				working-class areas peopled by Polish and other Middle-European immigrants remained
         untouched. The question of whether murals were valid only for minority-group ghetto
         areas or would
         				also be meaningful in white working-class neighborhoods was in the air. In those
         cities where the murals had begun with the Black Power thrust of the late sixties,
         a movement toward
         				more general themes was beginning. In 1974 Yasko began a mammoth mural in the
         <a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7015699">Logan Square area of Chicago</a>. The mural uses symbolic figures and images to identify the values of the
         				largely Polish and Bielorussian residents of the area and to depict them working
         together to maintain control in a highly technical, mechanized world. This major wal
         has opened the
         				door for a number of other murals in this and similar neighborhoods Yasko, however,
         is only one of many women muralists who have made important artistic contributions.
         <span style="font-style:italic">Lucy Mahler</span>'s
         				vivid mural at the Wright Brothers School in New York is one of the earliest murals
         on a public school building. <span style="font-style:italic">Astrid Fuller</span> with her distinctive combination 
         				 of a primitive literalism with surrealist images, has created a series of ambitious
         underpass murals in the <a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/2010686">Hyde Park area of Chicago</a>. <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/49182313/">Holly Highfill</a>, who painted an
         				anti-war mural in the Loop area of Chicago (1973), has gone on to do several succeeding
         walls with gang youth. <span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-style:italic">Marie Burton</span></span>, who with Highfill and Rogovin co-authored the Mural Manual,
         				works primarily with teenagers. Her Bored of Education in Chicago (1971) and the Celebration of Cultures in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37836">Milwaukee</a> (1975) are among the most impressive of the school murals. And
         				these are just a few of the women muralists working on community walls in a way
         that might be called the Chicago model (others are <span style="font-style:italic">Justine DeVan</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Esther Charbit</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Ruth Felton</span>, and
         				<span style="font-style:italic">Celia Radek</span>). </p>
      <p>In the Chicago model, the artist-leader of a mural team, using community and youth
         input, designs the wall and directs the painting of it. The community participates
         as a new class of
         				patrons who help to pay for the mural and are consulted on the design. In spite
         of the change in patronage, and participation of community people as team members
         the Chicago model's
         				emphasis on professionalism is fairly close to the mural tradition through the
         ages. Murals, after all, have rarely been painted by individuals; mostly they are
         done by a group of
         				assistants working under a master. </p>
      <p>This hierarchical process has been challenged by several developments within the mural
         movement. One is the experimentation with women muralists have come into the movement
         as organizers or members of a collective group. The mutual support and shared responsibility
         the collective offers an individual is often necessary to provide the courage to attempt
         a first
         				mural (and some of the labor power to finish it). Especially in the case of women
         this factor can be decisive. </p>
      <p>Within the Latin culture, machismo often reaches rather extreme forms yet this is
         countered by a strong communal tradition. It is not surprising therefore that in 1974
         a grounp of
         				Latin American women muralists--<a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/17163409148900092789/">Mujeres Muralistas</a>--was formed in San Francisco. Most of the women were students of recent graduates
         of the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q586735">San Francisco Art Institute</a> and connected
         				with the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5518465">Galeria de La Raza</a>, the center for Chicano artists in the Mission district. Their philosophy was simple
         and very positive: </p>Our cultures, our images are strong. It is important that the atmosphere of the world
      be plagued with color and life. Throughout history there have been very few women
      who have
      				figured in art. What you see is proof that women, too, can work at this level.
      That we can put together scaffolding and climb it. We offer you the colors that we
      make. 
      <p>Their two best-known walls, Latinoamerica and the Paco's Tacos Stand mural were both done in the spring and summer of 1974. They celebrate the beauty
         and richness of the Latin
         				tradition. For Latinoamerica, the four women comprising the original core of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q19630440">Mujeres Muralistas</a>-<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24007838">Patricia Rodriguez</a>, <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/33155224423584371184/">Consuelo Mendez Castillo</a>, <span style="font-style:italic">lrene Perez</span>, and <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/58093996/">Graciela Carrillo de
            				Lopez</a>--worked together to create the design. Different parts of the mural are painted by
         each artist in her individual style; yet the mural succeeds as a unified work because
         of the
         				clean organization, and the distinctively bright, clean color that is characteristic
         of the group. In the Paco's Tacos mural the unity is more tenuous. The wall divides
         into two
         				distinctly different halves reflecting the different artistic styles of Consuelo
         Mendez Castillo and Graciela Carrillo de Lopez. In many ways Mujeres Muralistas was
         never really a
         				"collective," but rather a group of women who came together to work on a particular
         wall mural. An almost instant fame forced them into a prematurely formalized existence
         as a
         				"collective group," while leaving them little time to resolve differences in political
         consciousness between members of the group, or cultural differences between Chicana
         and Latin
         				American women. The probem of individualism was never really tackled, although
         there was an attempt to make decisions by a consensus of the group. Internal differences
         caused the
         				group to dissolve formally early in 1976. The women who comprised Mujeres Muralistas
         are now working as individual muralists. </p>
      <p>Many mural-painting collectives, including most of those that grew out of the largely
         white-counterculture and anti-war movements, either start with women who then invite
         male artists
         				in, or simply include both women and men. Often led by women with roots in Marxism
         and feminism, these collectives tend to be strongly anti-sexist, anti-imperialist,
         and to use overtly
         				political images in their artwork. One of these groups was the Peoples Painters
         of New Jersey, who "muralized" <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4261030">Livingston College</a> from 1972 to 1974. Modeled after the Ramona Parra Brigades of Allendes Chile, the
         Peoples Painters were concerned equally with the political effects of their murals
         and with trying to overcome individualism and a sense of personal
         				ego. Their first wall was for the Livingston Women's Center which was very appropriate
         since the founders of the group--<span style="font-style:italic">Julia Smith</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Kathy Jones</span>, and myself--considered ourselves
         				activists in the Womens Liberation Movement. We worked on the design collectively,
         discussing ideas first and then finding the images. We chose to work in a simple style,
         using heavy
         				black outlines and flat color so that the women at the Center could help us paint.
         We also consciously worked over parts of the mural that others had originated to combat
         the
         				tendency to say at the end of the project, "And this part is mine." While we did
         not wholly succeed in eliminating our sense of personal ego, we did find that by consciously
         				emphasizing collectivity in our work we could overcome personal insecurities and
         achieve stronger political and artistic results. We went on to incorporate men into
         our group and
         				painted eight other murals before agreeing to disperse in 1974, when some of our
         members graduated and others decided to go on to other things. </p>
      <p>The <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/13166060379480322624/">Haight-Ashbury Muralists</a> in San Francisco, a collective led by <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29024307">Jane Norling</a>, see themselves as "anti-imperialist cultural workers." Their first mural, Ralnbow People, was
         				painted in 1972 as part of a large anti-war demonstration. A Haight landmark,
         Ralnbow People was repainted and updated in 1974. Unity Eye (1973) diagrams the ingredients
         for creating
         				a revolutionary culture in the United States. The mural shows a revolution peopled
         and led by women, and was painted by an all-female team. Most recently, the Haight-Ashbury
         				Muralists have been working on a 300-foot-long history of the class struggle in
         San Francisco. </p>
      <p>The most radical and problematic challenge to tradition has been the development of
         collective murals in which non-artist members of a community work with an artist-facilitator
         who
         				heips them to create their own mural. While a strong emphasis on community participation
         characterizes all community mural projects, this particular emphasis reflects an attempt
         to
         				create a "people's art" in every sense of the word. Simply providing paint and
         a wall to teenagers and young adults is not the answer. There must be a direction,
         a method for working
         				cooperatively, and a technique that makes it possible to bypass the need for years
         of study of drawing and design. </p>
      <p>The most complete method, and the model for much related work elsewhere in the nation,
         was developed by <span style="font-style:italic">Susan Shapiro-Kjok</span> and the Cityarts staff in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60">New York City</a>. This method begins
         				with a number of concept meetings during which the theme is discussed. In the
         early Cityarts Workshop murals, scenes were acted out and developed, photographed,
         and then projected
         				and traced. When the mock-up was complete, it was enlarged by an opaque projector
         and painted in. Black Women of Africa Today (1971), designed and executed by teenage
         girls at the
         				Smith housing project on the lower East Side, is typical of the early sithouette
         style. Later murals became more complex as the technique came to include the use of
         drawings and slides
         				as well as photographs and the opaque projector. The jewish ethnic mural at the
         Bialystoker Old People's Home is a collage of images designed and painted by a group
         of Jewish teenagers
         				under the direction of <span style="font-style:italic">Susan Caruso-Green</span> (current director of Cityarts Workshop). </p>
      <p>Two other collective walls were painted in 1974 and 1975 by Lower East Side women
         under the direction of Tomie Arai. The Wall of Respect for Women (1974) epitomizes the non¬
         				antagonistic type of feminism portrayed on non-white community walls dealing with
         the theme of woman. Rather than condemning more traditional womens roles (e.g. mother,
         telephone
         				operator), this mural celebrates all the roles played by women. The second wall,
         Women Hold Up Halt the Sky (1975), palnted by many of the same women who worked or
         the earlier wall, as
         				well as some men, portrays women's oppression within the context of the larger
         social struggle. Although most of the images come from a generalized women's experience,
         the figures
         				breaking out of oppression are of both sexes. In both walls women are shown performing
         their traditional jobs and, with few exceptions this is the way women are portrayed
         in community
         				walls. </p>
      <p>Some murals about women emphasize the biological factor and almost all include the
         mother-child theme. Yet these would be considered highly conservative images by the
         Womens
         				Liberation Movement. The use of such stereotypical images of women is not the
         result of ignorance on the part of women muralists. In part it reflects the goals
         of Third World
         				feminism, in which women's rights are seen as one part of the more general social
         struggle, and great care is taken to keep feminism from appearing to be a divisive
         force. </p>
      <p>Within political organizations like the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1163195">Puerto Rican Socialist Party</a> (PSP), political education courses discuss the need to overcome machismo and the
         oppressive role definitions which
         				make it difficult for men and women to work together as companeros. Some of the
         verses from the song "Quiero decirte" (I Want to Tell You Something), written collectively
         by Suni Paz,
         				Juana Diaz, and other Puerto Rican sisters in 1972 and often sung at political
         rallies and community events, state the changes in the male-female relationship for
         which they are
         				struggling: </p>
      <p>A la mujer me dirijo: </p>
      <p>tu tambien debes luchar </p>
      <p>para salir de una vez </p>
      <p>de tu gran pasividad. </p>
      <p>Al hombre le toca ahora: </p>
      <p>entiende que la mujer </p>
      <p>sabe pensar y sentir </p>
      <p>y tiene derechoa ser.</p>
      <p>(To the woman I say </p>
      <p>you must struggle to abandon </p>
      <p>your conditioned passivity </p>
      <p>and to leave it behind.</p>
      <p>To the man I say </p>
      <p>try to understand </p>
      <p>that a woman can think and feel, </p>
      <p>and hasa right to exist.) </p>
      <p>The mother in Latin culture is seen as the moral leader of the household and the authority
         in the education of her children. The forced sterilization of women by the U.S. government
         in
         				Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries (as well as the poor at home) has
         served to intensify the felt need for women to bear children in order topreserve their
         race This
         				creates certain differences in attitude about populaton control and the family
         structure between Third World feminism and the rest of the Vomens Liberation Movement.

      <p>Overtly feminist murals are found primarlly on Women's Center walls within the university
         world, and in certain selected city neighbor hoods--Haght-Ashbury, for example--where
         a base of
         				support exists. Most often, the feminist consciousness of women muralists is expressed
         bythesubstitution of female for male as asymbolic or heroic figure, or even by the
         mere
         				inclusion of women as active figures in any mural.</p>
      <p>The problem of responsibility to the permanentaudience, those who have to live with art, is one with which the community muralist
         is constantly faced. The ideal is to
         				work constantly at the cutting edge of issues–neither too far ahead nor too far
         behind. This is a continual struggle involving a constant series of difficult decisions
         and has been
         				a direct part of my own recent experience as a muralist. After several years of
         working in a relatively radicalized university setting, I undertook some murals in
         a very different
         				environment–a conservative small town in the Adirondack mountains. My problem
         was how to paint a bicentennial mural that would be accepted by the permanent residents
         as their history
         				and yet not violate my convictions, or the truth. Just as I began work in early
         1976, the very town authorities who were my sponsors whitewashed a youth mural on
         ecology I had directed in
         				1974, which was critical of the town's dumping sewage into the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7432908">Schroon River</a> . I conceived my design as a compromise: the ancestors of the present residents are
         shown as workers in the
         				logging industry, the saw mill, and the textile factories-a working-class history,
         but one with only positive images. I began painting the wall with great misgivings.
         It was the
         				reaction of the locals, and their enthusiastic hunger for their own history, that
         made me realize that it is not just minority-group people or urban ghetto residents
         who have been
         				deprived of their history and their right to their own art expression, but every
         segment of Americas working people. </p>
      <p>Communication between muralists around the nation has increased greatly since 1974.
         Three major mural conferences have occurred and the exchange of information and techniques
         has
         				furthered experimentation. Many muralists who previously worked alone have begun
         to experiment with collective techniques and vice versa. In 1975, for example, five
         muralists from the
         				Chicago Mural Group (Caryl Yasko, <span style="font-style:italic">Mitchell Caton</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Celia Radek</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Justine DeVan</span>, and L<span style="font-style:italic">ucyna Radycki</span>) worked on a coectively designed and painted wall, Prescripton for Good Heath Care.
         				The muralists were a mixed group-racially, sexually, and in terms of previous
         mural experience. This was their first collectively designed wall, although they had
         helped each other to
         				paint on other walls. The location at 5th and Kedzie is near the headquarters
         of the American Nazi Party in Chicago. Initially, there was some fear that racial
         attacks might prevent
         				the group from working, but there were no disturbances during the time the mural
         was being painted. Acceptance in this white working-class neighborhood of a racially
         mixed group of
         				muralists reflects the prestige that murals have achieved in Chicago. </p>
      <p>The continuing attempt at collectivity and away from the individualistic "genius"
         concept of the artist prevalent in the art world has been one of the major distinctions
         pioneered by
         				women in the mural movement; it derives at least in part from the influence of
         th Women's Liberation Movement. The non-hierarchical structures of the early women's
         organizations as well as the direct
         				experience of consciousness-raising groups with the sisterhood and support they
         provided, became a part of the outlook of a number of the women muralists. The changes
         resulting from
         				their individual experiences with Women's Liberation led them to bring the same
         egalitarian and collective practices to the mural groups they joined or helped found.
         </p>
      <p>While ideas from feminism and Marxism are implicit in the attempt to create a peoples
         art–especially in murals by women–the level of politicization and consciousness among
         muralists varies
         				greatly. Most community muralists, however, if they were familiar with Mao's words
         at the Yenan forum, would agree that:</p>In the world today all culture, all literature and art belong to
      				definite classes and are geared to definite political lines. There is in fact
      no such thing as Art for arts sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached
      from or independent of politics. 
      <p>If that is true, one must choose-and they have chosen. </p>
