      <p>Who the hell am l anyway</p>
      <p>Not to bow?</p>
      <p>In July 1973 I wrote an article for <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/198145541783196601418/">The Village Voice</a> about a hunger strike then
         				taking place at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Women%27s_House_of_Detention">Women's House of Detention (New York City Correctional
            				Institution for Women,</a> housing around 400 detention and sentenced women) on
         				<a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/315527979/">Riker's Island.</a> I used a pseudonym for the article because I was working at the time
         				at the prison as a mental health worker as well as teaching a poetry class, and
         I
         				wanted to keep both occupations. Many of the women in my class were involved in
         the
         				strike and were emphatic about the significance of their stand, although
         				traditionally women at Riker's were notoriously apolitical, even downright reaction¬
         				ary. Strikes had taken place before, but on issues such as cosmetics (the women
         				had wanted an Avon lady), more dances and recreation time or flashier products
         in
         				commissary. </p>
      <p>This strike was different. The women were demanding, among other things, a legal
         				library, an end to massive and lax prescription of "diagnostic" medication, decent
         				food, and limitation of solitary confinement to three days. At the Women's House,
         				where an old adage ran "all riots end at mealtime," this was pretty heady stuff.</p>
      <p>The article in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q876158">The Village Voice</a> (July 26, 1973) was supposed to get the world (or at
         				least <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11299">Manhattan</a>) listening and to familiarize people with a woman’s situation in
         				prison: incarceration for women is a somewhat different experience than it is
         					for men. Male prisoners are expected to be political in one form or another,
         					they are far better legally informed, and an atmosphere of "bonding" is
         					prevalent. (They are also considered more "trainable"—more vocational rehab
         					programs exist for men on Riker's Island.)</p>
      <p>The administration broke the back of the strike in its sixth day by separating the
         				ringleaders, transferring them to different housing areas, or locking them in
         the
         				"bing" (solitary). But it was too late. The article appeared and provoked a reaction
         				from the community: pressure was put on the warden. A few of the women’s demands
         				were met: a legal library was established, kitchen conditions were improved, and
         				other steps were taken. Someone from the class hand-printed a sign and put it
         up in
         				the classroom: WORDS CAN TURN THEM AROUND. </p>
      <p>This was a milestone. I had been teaching the class for about a year and felt that
         				although the women's response had been overwhelmingly enthusiastic, I was getting
         				nowhere in the actual teaching of writing. It wasn’t that the women were intimidated
         				by the act of writing. Far from it. They wrote to keep mentally alive, to keep
         sane.
         				When I first suggested the idea of a writing workshop to the warden, she scoffed
         at
         				it. "These women don’t write," she said. "They don’t read. The overall educational
         				level is poor. Reading, writing, comprehension... all very low." At the first
         class,
         				I learned that all the women "wrote"—they came to class lugging diaries, journals,
         				manuscripts full of long poems, ballads, stories. Everyone had a poem to "tell“;
         				poetry was a tradition; poems were written, read, copied by hand, and passed
         				around—a publishing network. No one owned a poem. All the poems rhymed, and all
         were
         				either sentimental love/religious verse or political rhetoric. My failure had
         been
         				the inability to let them see alternatives: a poem was not always an escape, a
         				fantasy, or a slogan, but a way into yourself, an illumination. Somehow the article,
         				which was about them, about their very real lives in clear, simple language, did
         it.
         				Someone said that a poem could be like reporting on your life, telling the story
         				of your life— journalism of the soul. They tried out this approach. <span style="font-style:italic">Millie Moss</span>, who
         				sat all day in front of the television watching commercials about getting away
         				from it all and listening to the planes (one every three minutes) take off from
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaGuardia_Airport">La
            				Guardia</a> a few hundred yards across the water from the prison, wrote the first.
         				(Millie had been a "hearts and flowers" verse writer: her poems were filled with
         				giggly sunsets“): </p>Fly Me, l'm Mildred
      <p>Finger my earring as I lean low</p>
      <p>over your bomber cocktail</p>
      <p>I've been known</p>
      <p>to put you on a throne</p>
      <p>send you off alone (not united)</p>
      <p>through the tomb-boom roar</p>
      <p>you get what you’re asking for</p>
      <p>when you fly me, honey,</p>
      <p>l'm Mildred.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Personally</h3>
      <p> So you spoke to me in silence</p>
      <p>in the ice man's choir </p>
      <p>and I dangled all the while</p>
      <p>You said (in silence) </p>
      <p>live each day </p>
      <p>spittin' on <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109858">Fifth Avenue</a></p>
      <p>fox-trottin' in hell</p>
      <p>So we ain’t home— </p>
      <p>we’re together </p>
      <p>Smile: </p>
      <p>I take it personally</p>
      <p>They were on fire. I told them about <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189950">Mandelstam</a>, <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/6074160486121805180007/">Dostoyevsky</a>, the long tradition of
         				writers in prison. I read them poems. Another woman, <span style="font-style:italic">Elizabeth Powell</span>, came to class
         				with a poem about homosexuality which was explicit, honest, and skillfully done.
         				The class praised it Elizabeth left the class that night, made a sheaf of copies
         by
         				hand, and passed it "on the vine." The next time I arrived at the prison, I was
         				called into the warden’s office. A member of my class, the warden said, had written
         				a poem about her "unique perversion" and had implied, she said, that there were
         also
         				correction officers who were homosexual, one in particular. She spoke of libel,
         				telling me that I should have confiscated the poem immediately, or at least made
         				sure that it didn’t go beyond the class. (Though homosexuality was indeed common—
         				the "only game" in the prison, the warden steadfastly refused to admit that she
         had
         				any more than-a few "deviants" on her hands, whom she described as hard-core—in
         				other words, gay even on the outside. Actually, as is the case in most women's
         				prisons, homosexual relationships were standard even for straights, for the simple
         				reason that human beings need physical intimacy and affection when they are confined
         				to correctional institutions and cut off from relationships available to them
         				outside the walls. Definitions of personal sexuality tend to change behind bars.
         				Upon release, some women remain "changed," while the majority of former prisoners
         				return to heterosexual lifestyles. The warden deeply feared homosexuality; any
         				manifestation of "butch" conduct was enough to tag an inmate a troublemaker and
         				"male attire" was expressly forbidden in the rules guide. Correction officers
         were
         				warned not to wear pants to work, and thus their uniform remained skirted.
         				(Although many C.O.'s were, in fact, gay, the atmosphere reflected the warden's
         				artificial notion of femininity.</p>
      <p>After this incident, I was informed that the poem had been confiscated and that
         				Elizabeth Powell had been placed in solitary confinement pending a hearing by
         the
         				disciplinary board. I was told that I would be allowed to continue the poetry
         class
         				for the time being, but that if another incident like this took place, I would
         be
         				asked to leave the prison. The warden sincerely hoped that I had "learned a
         				lesson."</p>
      <p>I had. It was just as I had told them: a dramatic testimony to the power of
         				words—and, thought, one of the stupidest things I have ever done. It was easy
         for me
         				to drop in and talk about "getting it down right“ and being honest in writing—I
         went
         				home every night. For me, there was no danger of being thrown in solitary, having
         my
         				personal papers raided, or worse. It occurred to me that even when l had written
         my
         				ever-so-honest article, I had used a pseudonym to protect myself. There were
         				obviously bigger risks than job loss at stake for women or men who chose to write
         				while incarcerated; risks l had clearly not understood. Words could indeed turn
         				around the authorities, but could also turn them into the oppressors they actually
         				were.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Powell was in the bing for three weeks. When she came back to class, she
         				was ready to go another round (she had written 25 poems, all dealing with
         				homosexuality, while in lock), but I had made a decision. I explained how I felt
         as
         				an outsider with no right to tell them how to write in this volatile situation,
         but
         				I asked that they make a distinction between public and private poems to protect
         				themselves from exactly this kind of censorship/punishment. Private poems were,
         				obviously, ones you could get thrown in the bing for; public poems could be
         				"published." At this point, I also went back to the warden and told her she should
         				not be surprised at some "emotional" poems; I described the class as "therapy"
         and
         				she agreed that that was a good way of viewing it.</p>
      <p>The class flourished. The women began to express themselves, to find words underneath
         				and in the midst of the gloss of everyday language. Some discovered (recovered?)
         a
         				subterranean language like subway graffiti: the poem became a Kilroy, a zap: "I
         				was here."</p>
      <p>I had quit my mental health worker job and was concentrating on expanding FREE SPACE,
         				as the class had come to be called. The <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1967116">NEA</a> had given us some funding, as did Poets
         				&amp; Writers and some local banks. <span style="font-style:italic">Linda Stewart</span> of The Book-of-the-Month Club
         				mailed boxes of overstocked paperback books; we amassed our own library and <span style="font-style:italic">Ted Slate</span> of Newsweek donated supplies and equipment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_E._Weatherly_Jr.">Tom Weatherly</a> taught a second poetry class, <span style="font-style:italic">Gail Rosenblum</span> taught fiction, and <span style="font-style:italic">Fannie James</span>, an ex-inmate, ex-student of the Space whom the warden actually allowed to
         				come back to work with us, taught poetry and library skills. Each teacher learned
         to
         				cope in his or her own way with the trials of trying to run a writing class in
         a
         				prison. Each class was like a hypothetical leap: it would take place 1) IF the
         				officer in  the housing area remembered to announce it; 2) IF the women
         				were there and not a) in court b) in solitary c) in another part of the prison
         d)
         				watching television e) sleeping and/or drugged f) transferred to another floor
         g)
         				trans- ferred to another prison h) out on bail (good news); 3) IF the officer
         on
         				hall duty okayed the passes; 4) IF the warden had not scheduled something else
         in
         				your classroom (usually a course in etiquette); 5) IF there was no "contraband,"
         				i.e., spiral notebooks (the wire is a potential weapon), chewing gum (jams locks),
         				tweezers, or snap-top pens (another weapon—only ball points or pencils allowed).</p>
      <p>Somehow, the class took place and thrived. Visitors came to read and comment on
         				student work: poets <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q87410543">Mae Jackson</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5219218">Daniela Gioseffi</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17411190">Daniel Halper</a>n, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q463319">Audre Lorde</a>. For
         				a long time, everyone learned. Information was taken in, absorbed—classes were
         spent
         				writing and rewriting, letting off steam.</p>
      <p>Almost four years later, most of the women from the old class had been transferred
         or
         				freed (detention women often spend two years waiting for trial), but emphasis
         was
         				still placed on getting along." We all stressed writing as craft.art style Classes were run
         				as any outside workshop would be, except no one ever published anything.</p>
      <p>The poetry class at this time was full of women who were considered potential
         				security threats—in other words, intelligent, outspoken, and funny. Some were
         				"controversial" cases: <span style="font-style:italic">Juanita Reedy</span>, about to have her first child behind bars;
         				<a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/63352640/">Carole Ramer</a> who had been busted with <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q306514">Abbie Hoffman</a> and who had a lot to say about
         				everything; <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/43354610/">Gloria Jensen</a>, whose imagination was like a vaudeville show; <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q467961">Assata
            				Shakur</a>/Joanne Chesimard—alleged leader of the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2545743">Black Liberation Army</a>, brilliant and
         				talented, with a Cool-Hand Luke aura of insouciance, compassion, and tenacity.
         				(Assata was considered so dangerous that the prison required her to have a
         				continual guard-escort.) These women were all good writers. They had learned craft
         				and practiced it—and wanted more. They wanted to go further than "therapeutic"
         				writing or workshop poems. They were writing dynamite.</p>
      <p>After four years, there was a huge pile of handwritten poems, Fannie's log with the
         				names of every woman who had come to class, some incredible memories, and that
         was
         				all. We went to the prison week after week and no one ever saw or heard what the
         				women wrote: the voices were never heard outside, and on the inside, only in class.
         				I began to feel that something had to give—no matter what risks were involved
         for
         				the women (if they should decide to publish)and for FREE SPACE as a writing
         				program. It was Catch 22—we were losing either way. At this stage, the women were
         				denied the natural fulfillment of self-expression, which is publication. If we
         				published their writing, however, we stood to lose the writing program itself.
         I
         				began to fantasize about getting the word out: if people could only hear some
         of
         				this stuff, I thought, no one would ever ask me again about either the quality
         of
         				prisoners' writing or the reasons for running workshops in prisons. We would have
         				evidence in writing. Best of all, the women would have the audience they deserved.
         I
         				began to draft a rough script, a framework for some of the poems.</p>
      <p>What happened to Juanita Reedy made up everybody's mind about publication. Juanita
         				went to Elmhurst Hospital to have her child and was treated so inhumanely that
         she
         				refused to let prison doctors touch her upon her return. She wrote a poem about
         her
         				experience, which she developed into a longer "Birth Journal." She published it in
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q106091070">Majority Report</a>, the feminist journal. In the same issue there was an article about
         				FREE SPACE and a poem by Carole Ramer. The issue began to circulate in the prison.
         				Assata, inspired by Juanita, wrote her own "Birth Journal" and sent it to a major
         				magazine. One night in class she read this poem:</p>
      <h3 align="left">Butch </h3>
      <p>You should have told me </p>
      <p> About your dick </p>
      <p> Stashed inside your bureau drawer</p>

      <p> Come, fuck me.</p>
      <p>(@ Assata Shakur/Joanne Chesimard) </p>
      <p>Some of Assata’s poems were accepted for publication in, a literary magazine. Poets
         				&amp; Writers gave us a grant to do an anthology of students' writing which Gail and
         				I compiled. We published it through the <span style="font-style:italic">Print Center in Brooklyn</span> and called it
         				Songs from a Free Space: Writings by Women in Prison. The anthology was sold in
         New
         				York bookstores and distributed to the women in the classes.</p>
      <p>It contained some of the best work done in the classes. By now I had handed over a
         				rough script to the poetry class and an idea about doing some kind of theater
         piece.
         				The women put together a revue of loosely scripted poems, songs, and vignettes
         				called Next Time. They memorized lines and improvised costumes. <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/7163456189304813715/">Karen Sanderson</a>, a
         				friend and videotape expert, arrived at the prison one Sunday with a crew of women
         				(after endless haggling for permission; we told the Corrections Department that
         we
         				needed the videotape as a rehearsal tool for a play) and taped for nine hours
         				straight. Finally, after months of editing, a half-hour tape emerged which documents
         				the poems, songs, love, and exasperation of some of these incredible women. (This
         				tape is available to anyone interested.)</p>
      <p>In September 1975, <span style="font-style:italic">FREE SPACE</span> merged with <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/157557651/">ART WITHOUT WALLS</a>, another arts project for
         				women in prison. Now we were able to offer graphic arts and dance, in addition
         to
         				having a larger staff. The publishing idea had fulfilled itself, a renaissance.
         				Juanita had begun a book about her experiences; another woman, <span style="font-style:italic">Isabelle Newton</span>, was
         				collecting her poems in manuscript. Then Assata, who had been held in solitary
         				for one year in New Jersey, whose cell was raided by guards every day in search
         of
         				contraband, and who had been beaten by the prison goon squad on numerous
         				occasions, completed her book of poems and wrote two chapters of a book, an account
         				of her arrest and life in prison. The warden stopped me in the hall one day and
         told
         				me that she knew we were collaborating on a book with Assata and Juanita. She
         told
         				me she hadn’t forgotten the Elizabeth Powell case.</p>
      <p>On November 26, 1975, Gail was preparing to leave home to go to her fiction class
         				(filled with new students) when the phone rang. It was Deputy Freeman, the WHD
         				Program Director, who advised her not to come to class: the program had been
         				cancelled. We were not allowed to do anything after that except to pick up our
         books
         				and any program belongings; we couldn’t say good-bye to anyone or discuss plans
         for
         				any of their work.</p>
      <p>Naturally, we are contesting this decision, but there isn’t much hope in appealing
         a
         				warden’s whim. It is, after all, her turf. Official reasons for the cancellation
         				were said to be duplication of services (they stated that the public school provided
         				the same type of classes) and irregularity of classes. The warden refused, however
         				to put these reasons in writing for us. It is clear that the writing classes were
         				taken seriously only when the women wrote seriously about their lives and published
         				those writings. Poetry is safe, women are safe until they begin to make sense
         and
         				communicate. Still, ART  recognizes the possibilities of
         				self-expression, perhaps the walls crack a little. Perhaps. Words can, indeed,
         turn
         				them around, but sometimes having all the right words is small change. "Before
         				despairing, speak of it," said a woman one day in class. Even when writing of
         				despair there’s the fact—named and held to the light for a moment—maybe even under¬
         				stood.</p>
      <p>WITHOUT WALLS/FREE SPACE is continuing to work at a children’s center, a drug clinic,
         				and another women’s prison. It’s important to maintain the lifelines between
         				people on the outside and those inside.</p>
      <p>But what happened at the Women's House of Detention can easily happen again.
         				Especially if publishing is, as it should be, part of the writing project. Prison
         				writers have a right to be heard as does any writer. Their voices are too impor¬
         				tant to be missed. Publishing is part of the art of not bowing. Each time a man
         or
         				woman in a cell</p>
      <h3 align="left">Next Time </h3><br />(group poem from the videotape 
      <p>of the same name) </p>
      <p> You don’t hear me </p>
      <p> You don't see me </p>
      <p>I'm the one just a step behind you </p>
      <p> a split second before the light changes on the</p>
      <p> corner. </p>
      <p> The face that breaks the glass without a sound </p>
      <p> The hands that take your money on a </p>
      <p> screaming train uptown.</p>
      <p>Ladies. I had nowhere to take myself tonight </p>
      <p> Except to myself </p>
      <p> To my own face </p>
      <p> Reflected in yours </p>
      <p> And my own voice </p>
      <p> telling me </p>
      <p> THERE IS NO NEXT TIME FOR ANY OF US </p>
      <p>Just the husbands and families waiting </p>
      <p> Just the habits and fast money waiting </p>
      <p>The kids in the street The kids in strangers' homes The kids in our bellies The
         					kids we are inside And the lies we tell ourselves To go on living LISTEN No one
         					got over on you tonight No one lied here tonight We told the truth And the truth
         					is what you see before your eyes Ladies Before you forget, ladies, Till the
         					"next time" My best.</p>
