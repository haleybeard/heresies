      <h3 align="left">The Pink Glass Swan: Upward and Downward Mobility in the Art
         						World</h3>
      <h5><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q137115">Lucy
            						R.Lippard</a></h5>
      <p> Another aspect of this conflict surfaces in discussions around who gets a "piece
         					of the pie" - a phrase which has become the scornful designation for what is
         					actually most peoples goal. (Why shouldn't artists be able to make a living in
         					this society like everybody else? Well, almost  everybody else.)
         					Those working for "cultural change" through political theorizing and occasional
         					actions are opposed to anybody getting a piece of the pie, though politics
         					appears to be getting fashionable again in the art world and may itself provide
         					a vehicle for internal success; today one can refuse a piece of the pie and
         					simultaneously be getting a chance at it. Still, the pie is very small and there
         					are a lot of hungry people circling it. Things were bad enough when only men
         					were allowed to take a bite. Since "aggressive women" have gotten in there too,
         					competition, always at the heart of the art-world class system, has peaked.</p>
      <p> Attendance at any large art school in the U.S. takes students from all classes
         					and trains them for artists' schizophrenia. While being cool and chicly grubby
         					(in the "uniform" of mass production), and knowing what's the latest in taste
         					and what's the kind of art to make and the right names to drop is clearly
         					"upward mobility" – from school into teaching jobs and/or the art world-the
         					lifestyle accompanying these habits is heavily weighted "downward." The working-class
         girl who has had to work for nice clothes must drop into frayed jeans to
         					make it into the art middle class, which in turn considers itself both upper
         and
         					lower class. Choosing poverty is a confusing experience for a child whose
         					parents (or more likely mother) have tried desperately against great odds to
         					keep a clean and pleasant home.  </p>
      <p> The artist who feels superior to the rich because s/he is disguised as someone
         					who is poor provides a puzzle for the truly deprived. A parallel notion, rarely
         					admitted but pervasive, is that a person can't understand "art" if their house
         					is full of pink glass swans or their lawn is inhabited by gnomes and flamingos,
         					or if they even care about house and clothes at all. This is particularly
         					ridiculous now, when art itself uses so much of this paraphernalia (and not
         					always satirically); or, from another angle, when even artists who have no
         					visible means of professional support live in palatial lofts and sport beat-up
         					$100 boots while looking down on the "tourists" who come to
         						<span style="font-style:italic">SoHo</span> to see art on Saturdays; SoHo is, in fact, the
         					new suburbia. One reason for such callousness is a hangover from the 1950s, when
         					artists really were poor and proud of being poor because their art, the argument
         					went, must be good if the bad guys - the rich and the masses - didn't like
         					it.</p>
      <p>In the 1960s the choice of poverty, often excused as <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1783091">anti-consumerism</a>, even
         					infiltrated the esthetics of art. Actually nothing
         						new; the history of modern art demonstrates a constant longing for the
         						primitive, the simple, the clear, the "poor," the noble naif, etc.
         					First there was <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q134147">Pop Art</a>, modeled on kitsch, on advertising and consumerism, and
         					equally successful on its own level. (Women, incidentally, participated little
         					in Pop
         						Art, partly because of
         					its blatant sexism, sometimes presented as a parody of the image of woman in
         the
         					media–and partly because the subject matter was often "women's work," ennobled
         
         					and acceptable only when the artists were men.) Then came <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q545851">Process Art</a>–a rebellion against the
         
         					"precious object" traditionally desired and bought by the rich. Here another
         					kind of co-optation took place, when temporary piles of dirt, oil, rags and
         					filthy rubber began to grace carpeted living rooms. The Italian branch was even
         					called <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q576913">Arte Povera</a>. Then came the rise of a third-stream medium called
         					"<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q203209">conceptual art</a>" which offered "anti-objects" in the form of ideas–books or
         					simple xeroxed texts and photographs with no inherent physical or monetary value
         
         					(until they got on the market, that is). Conceptual art seemed politically viable
         because of
         
         					its notion that the use of ordinary, inexpensive, unbulky media would lead to
         a
         					kind of socialization (or at least democratization) of art as opposed to
         					gigantic canvases and huge chrome sculptures costing five figures and filling
         					the world with more consumer fetishes.</p>
      <p> Yet the trip from of on canvas to ideas on xerox was, in retrospect, yet another
         					instance of "downward mobility" or middle-class guilt. It was no accident that
         					conceptual art appeared at the height of the social movements of the late 1960s
         					nor that the artists were sympathetic to those movements (with the qualified
         					exception of the women's movement). All of the esthetic tendencies listed above
         					were genuinely instigated as rebellions by the artists themselves, yet the fact
         					remains that only rich people can afford to 1) spend money on art that won't
         					last; 2) live with "ugly art" or art that is not decorative, because the rest
         of
         					their surroundings are beautiful and comfortable; 3) like "non-object art" which
         					is only handy If you already have too many possessions-when it becomes a
         					reactionary commentary: art for the overprivileged in a consumer society.</p>
      <p> As a child, I was accused by my parents of being an "anti-snob snob" and I'm
         					only beginning to see the limitations of such a rebellion. Years later I was
         an
         					early supporter of and proselytizer for conceptual art as escape from the
         					commodity orientation of the art world, a way of communicating with a broader
         					audience via inexpensive media. Though I was bitterly disappointed (with the
         					social, not the esthetic achievements) when I found that this work could be so
         					easily absorbed into the system, it is only now that I've realized why the
         					absorption took place. Conceptual art's democratic efforts and physical vehicles
         					were cancelled out by its neutral, elitist content and its patronizing approach.
         					From around 1967 to 1971, most of us involved in conceptual art saw that content
         					as pretty revolutionary and thought of ourselves as rebels against the cool,
         					hostile artifacts of the prevailing formalist and minimal art. But we were so
         					totally enveloped in the middle-class approach to everything we did and saw,
         we
         					couldn't perceive how that pseudo-academic narrative piece or that
         					art-world-oriented action  in the streets was deprived of any
         					revolutionary content by the fact that it was usually incomprehensible and
         					alienating to the people "out there," no matter how fashionably downwardly
         					mobile it might be in the art world. The idea that if art is subversive in the
         					art world it will automatically appeal to a general audience now seems
         					absurd.</p>
      <p> The whole evolutionary basis of modernist innovation, the idea of esthetic
         					"progress," the "I-did-it-first" and "it's-been-done-already" syndromes which
         					pervade contemporary avant garde art and criticism, are also blatantly classist,
         and
         					have more to do with technology than with art. To be "avant-garde" is inevitably
         					to be on top or to become upper-middle-class, because such innovations take
         					place in a context accessible only to the educated elite. Thus socially
         					conscious artists working in or with community groups and muralists try to
         					disassociate themselves from the art world, even though its values ("quality")
         					remain to haunt them personally.</p>
      <p> The value systems are different in and out of the art world, and anyone
         					attempting to straddle the two develops another kind of schizophrenia. For
         
         					instance, in the inner-city community murals, as <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q106308202">Eva Cockcroft</a>
         
         					points out elsewhere in this publication, the images of woman are the
         					traditional ones–a beautiful, noble mother and housewife or worker, and a
         					rebellious young woman striving to change her world-both of them celebrated for
         					their courage to be and to stay the way they are and to support their men in
         the
         					face of horrendous odds. This is not the art-world or middle-class "radical"
         					view of future feminism, nor is it one which radical feminists hoping to "reach
         					out" across the classes can easily espouse. Here, in the realm of aspirations,
         					is where upward and downward mobility and status quo clash, where the economic
         					class barriers are established. As <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/11163457050804813684/">Michele Russell</a>
         					has noted,  the Third-World woman is not attracted to the
         
         					"Utopian experimentation" of the left (in the art world, the would-be Marxist
         						avant-garde) or to the
         					"pragmatic opportunism" of the right (in the art world, those who reform and
         					co-opt the "radicals").</p>
      <p> Many of the subjects touched on here come back to Taste. To a poor woman, art,
         					or a beautiful object, might be defined as something she cannot have. Beauty
         and
         					art have been defined before as the desirable. In a consumer society, art too
         					becomes a commodity rather than a life-enhancing experience. Yet the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5582">Van
            						Gogh</a> reproduction or the pink glass swan–the same beautiful
         					objects that may be "below" a middleclass woman (because she has, in moving
         					upward, acquired upper-class taste, or would like to think she has) - may be
         					"above" or inaccessible to a welfare mother. The phrase "to dictate taste" has
         					its own political connotations. A Minneapolis worker interviewed by students
         of
         					artist <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28873078">Don Celender</a> said
         					he liked "old art works because they're more classy,"  and class does seem to be what the traditional notion of art is
         					all about. Yet contemporary avant-garde art, for all its attempts to break out
         					of that gold frame, is equally class-bound, and even the artist aware of these
         					contradictions in her/his own life and work is hard-put to resolve them. It's
         a
         					vicious circle If the artist/producer is upper-middle-class, and our standards
         					of art as taught in schools are persistently upper-middle-class, how do we
         					escape making art only for the upper-middle-class?</p>
      <p> The alternatives to "quality," to the "high" art shown in art-world galleries
         					and magazines have been few, and for the most part unsatisfying, although
         					well-intended. Even when kitsch,
         					politics or housework are absorbed into art, contact with the real world is not
         					necessarily made. At no time has the avant garde, though playing in the famous
         					"gap between art and life," moved far enough out of the art context to attract
         a
         					broad audience-that audience which has, ironically, been trained to think of
         art
         					as something that has nothing to do with life and, at the same time, tends only
         					to like that art which means something in terms of its own life, or fantasies.
         					The dilemma for the leftist artist in the middle class is that her/his standards
         					seem to have been set irremediably. No matter how much we know about what the
         					broader public wants, or needs, it is very difficult to break social
         					conditioning and cultural habits. Hopefully, a truly feminist art will provide
         					other standards.</p>
      <p> To understand the woman artist's position in this complex situation between the
         					art world and the real world, class and gender, it is necessary to know that
         in
         					America artists are rarely respected unless they are stars or rich or mad or
         					dead. Being an artist is not being "somebody." Middle-class families are happy
         					to pay lip service to art but god forbid their own children take it so seriously
         					as to consider it a profession. Thus a man who becomes an artist is asked when
         					he is going to "go to work," and he is not-so-covertly considered a child, a
         					sissy (a woman), someone who has a hobby rather than a vocation, someone who
         					can't make money and therefore cannot hold his head up in the real world of
         					men—at least until his work sells, at which point he may be welcomed back. Male
         					artists, bending over backward to rid themselves of this stigma, tend to be
         					particularly susceptible to insecurity and machismo. So women daring to insist
         					on their place in the primary rank–as art makers rather than as art housekeepers
         					(curators, critics, dealers, "patrons")–inherit a heavy burden of male fears
         in
         					addition to the economic and psychological  discrimination still
         					rampant in a patriarchal, money-oriented society.</p>
      <p> Most art being shown now has little to do with any woman's experience, in part
         					because women-rich ones as "patrons," others as decorators and "home-makers"—are
         in charge of the private sphere, while men identify more easily with public
         					art-art that has become public through economic validation (the million-dollar
         
         						<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5598">Rembrandt)</a>. Private art is often seen as mere ornament; public art is associated with monuments
         and
         
         					money, with "high" art and its containers, including unwelcoming whitewalled
         					galleries and museums with classical courthouse architecture. Even the graffiti
         						artists, whose work was
         					unsuccessfully transferred from subways to art galleries, were all men,
         					concerned with facades, with having their names in spray paint, in lights, in
         					museums...</p>
      <p> Private art is visible only to intimates. I suspect the reason so few women
         
         					"folk" artists work outdoors in
         
         					large scale (like <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt8k402266/">Simon
            						Rodia</a>'s Watts Towers and
         					other "naives and visionaries" with their cement and bottles) is not only
         					because men aspire to erections and know how to use the necessary tools, but
         					because women can and must assuage these same creative urges inside the house,
         					with the pink glass swan as an element in their own works of art the living room
         					or kitchen. In the art world the situation is doubly paralleled. Women's art
         					until recently was rarely seen in public and all artists are voluntarily "women"
         					because of the social attitudes mentioned above; the art world is so small that
         					it is "private."</p>
      <p> Just as the living room is enclosed by the building it is in, art and artist are
         					firmly imprisoned by the culture which supports them. Artists claiming to work
         					for themselves alone, and not for any audience at all, are passively accepting
         					the upper-middle class audience of the internal art world. This is compounded
         by
         					the fact that to be middle-class is to be passive, to live with the expectation
         					of being taken care of and entertained. But art should be a
         					consciousness-raiser; it partakes of and should fuse the private and the public
         					spheres. It should be able to reintegrate the personal without being satisfied
         					by the merely personal. One good test is whether or not it communicates, and
         					then, of course, what and how it communicates. If it doesn't communicate it may
         					just not be very good art from anyone's point of view; or it may be that the
         					artist is not even aware of the needs of others, or simply doesn't care.</p>
      <p> For there is a need out there, a need vaguely satisfied at the moment by
         						"schlock."  And it seems that one of the basic tenets of the feminist
         					arts should be a reaching out from the private sphere to transform that
         					"artificial art" and to more fully satisfy that need. For the art-world artist
         					has come to consider her/his private needs paramount, and has too often
         					forgotten about those of the audience, any audience. Work that communicates to
         a
         					dangerous number of people is derogatorily called a "crowd pleaser." This is
         a
         					blatantly classist attitude, taking for granted that most people are by nature
         					incapable of understanding good art (ie., upper-class or quality art). At the
         					same time, much ado is made about art-educational theories that claim to "teach
         					people to see" (consider the political implications of this notion) and muffle
         					all issues by stressing the "universality" of great art.</p>
      <p> It may be that at the moment the possibilities are slim for a middle-class art
         					world's understanding or criticism of the little art we see that reflects
         					working-class cultural values. Perhaps our current responsibility lies in
         					humanizing our own activities so that they will communicate more effectively
         					with all women. Hopefully we will aspire to more than women's art flooding the
         					museum and gallery circuit. Perhaps a feminist art will only emerge when we
         					become wholly responsible for our own work, for what becomes of it, who sees
         it,
         					and who is nourished by it. For a feminist artist, whatever her style, the prime
         					audience at this time is other women. So far, we have tended to be satisfied
         					with communicating with those women whose social experience is close to ours.
         					This is natural enough, since this is where we will get our greatest support,
         					and we need support in taking this risk of trying to please women, knowing that
         					we are almost certain to displease men in the process. In addition, it is
         
         					embarrassing to talk openly about the class system which divides us, hard to
         do so
         
         					without sounding more bourgeois than ever in the implications of superiority
         and
         					inferiority inherent in such discussions (where the working class is as often
         					considered superior as the middle class).</p>
      <p> A book of essays called Class and Feminism written by
         						<span style="font-style:italic">The Furies</span>, a lesbian feminist collective, makes clear
         					that from the point of view of working-class women, class is a definite problem
         					within the women's movement. As <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/79318339/">Nancy Myron</a> observes,
         					middle-class women: can intellectualize, politicize, accuse, abuse and
         						contribute money in order not to deal with their own classism. Even if they
         						admit that class exists, they are not likely to admit that their behavior is
         						a product of it. They will go through every painful detail of their lives to
         						prove to me or another working-class woman that they really didn't have any
         						privilege, that their family was exceptional, that they actually did have an
         						uncle who worked in a factory. To ease anyone's guilt is not the point of
         						talking about class... You don't get rid of oppression just by talking about
         						it.</p>
      <p>Women are more strenuously conditioned toward upward cultural mobility or
         					"gentility" than men, which often results in the woman consciously betraying
         her
         					class origins as a matter of course. The hierarchies within the whole span of
         					the middle class are most easily demarcated by lifestyle and dress. For
         					instance, the much-scorned "Queens housewife" may have enough to eat, may have
         					learned to consume the unnecessities, and may have made it to a desired social
         					bracket in her community, but if she ventures to make art (not just own it),
         she
         					will find herself back at the bottom in the art world, looking wistfully up to
         					the plateau where the male, the young, the bejeaned seem so at ease.</p>
      <p> For middle-class women in the art world not only dress "down," but dress like
         					working-class men. They do so because housedresses, pedal pushers, polyester
         					pantsuits, perrnanents, the wrong accents are not such acceptable disguises for
         					women as the boots, overalls and win breaker syndromes are for men. Thus young
         					middle-class women tend to deny their female counterparts and take on "male"
         					(unisex) attire. It may at times have been chic to dress like a native
         						American or a Bedouin
         						woman, but it has never
         					been chic to dress like a working class woman, even if she's trying to look like
         						<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q165421">Jackie Kennedy</a>.
         					Young working-class women (and men) spend a large amount of avallable money on
         					clothes; it's a way to forget the rats and roaches by which even the cleanest
         					tenement-dwellers are blessed, or the mortgages by which even the
         					hardest-working homeowners are blessed, and to present a classy facade. Artists
         					dressing and talking "down" insult the hardhat much as rich kids in rags do;
         					they insult people whose notion of art is something to work for-the pink glass
         					swan.</p>
      <p> Yet women, as evidenced by the Furies' publication, and as pointed out elsewhere
         					(most notably by <span style="font-style:italic">Bebel</span>), have a unique chance to
         					communicate with women across the boundaries of economic class because as a
         					"vertical class" we share the majority of our most fundamental
         					experiences-emotionally, even when economically we are divided. Thus an economic
         					analysis does not adequately explore the psychological and esthetic
         					ramifications of the need for change within a sexually oppressed group. Nor does
         					it take into consideration that women's needs are different from men's-or so
         it
         					seems at this still unequal point in history. The vertical class cuts across
         the
         					horizontal economic classes in a column of injustices. While heightened class
         					consciousness can only clarify the way we see the world, and all clarification
         					is for the better, I can't bring myself to trust hard lines and categories where
         					fledgling feminism is concerned.</p>
      <p> Even in the art world, the issue of feminism has barely been raised in mixed
         					political groups. In 1970, women took our rage and our energies to our own
         					organizations, or directly to the public by means of picketing and protests.
         					While a few men supported these, and most politically conscious male artists
         now
         					claim to be feminists to some degree, the political and apolitical art world
         					goes on as though feminism didn't exist-the presence of a few vociferous
         					feminist artists and critics not withstanding. And in the art world, as in the
         					real world, political commitment frequently means total disregard for feminist
         					priorities. Even the increasingly Marxist group ironically calling itself
         						<span style="font-style:italic">Art- Language</span> is unwilling to stop the exclusive use of
         					the male pronoun in its theoretical publications. </p>
      <p> Experiences like this one and dissatisfaction with Marxism's lack of interest in
         "the woman
         					question" make me wary of merging Marxism and feminism. The notion of the
         					non-economic or "vertical" class is anathema to Marxists and confusion is
         					rampant around the chicken-egg question of whether women can be equal before
         					the establishment of a classless society or whether a classless society can be
         					established before women are liberated. As <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q432851">Sheila Rowbotham</a>
         					says of her own Marxism and feminism: They are at once incompatible and
         						in real need of one another. As a feminist and a Marxist I carry their
         						contradictions within me and it is tempting to opt for one or the other in
         						an effort to produce a tidy resolution of the commotion generated by the
         						antagonism between them. But to do that would mean evading the social
         						reality which gives rise to the antagonism. </p>
      <p>As women, therefore, we need to establish far more strongly our own sense of
         					community, so that all our arts will be enjoyed by all women in all economic
         					circumstances. This will happen only when women artists make conscious efforts
         to cross class barriers, to consider their audience, to see, respect, work
         					with the women who create outside the art world-whether in suburban crafts
         					guilds or in offices and factories or in community workshops. The current
         					feminist passion for women's traditional arts, which influences a great many
         					women artists, should make this road much easier, undess it too becomes
         					another commercialized rip-off. Despite the very real class obstacles, I feel
         					strongly that women are in a privileged position to satisfy the goal of an art
         					which would communicate the needs of all classes and sexes to each other, and
         					get rid ofthe we/they dichotomy to as great an extent as is possible in a
         					capitalist framework. Our sex, our oppression and our female experience–our
         					female culture, just being explored–offer access to all of us by these common
         					threads.</p>
