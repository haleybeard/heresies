Dear __
I am convening an ad hoc working group of ADHO governance representatives to focus on ways in which ADHO should analyse participant data to better understand, inform, and collaborate with our colleagues across the constituent organizations. ADHO's data needs, and our ability to collect data, are equally complex. We need to consider information related not only to the annual conferences, but also to membership and its implications for ADHO's financial health, the activities we support, and the ways in which we function.

I've attached, for your information, the proposal that was approved by the COB last month. I hope that this working group will address data issues on a priority basis, reporting regularly on our progress to the EB and COB, and with final recommendations submitted, if possible, by the end of the year.

I anticipate that we will be able to complete much of our business asynchronously, with (hopefully) one in-person meeting at DH2023 in July.
I'd like to keep this working group small and nimble, with equal representation from: the EB, COB, CCC, IITF, and Treasurers. 

Please note that our sole data source to date has been ConfTool. Because ConfTool information is gathered to track authorship, reviewer capabilities, and registration, there is a signficiant amount of personal information that cannot be shared in any public format. We will need to come up with protocols to undertake this work, whereby our colleagues can *opt in* to any kind involves any kind of personal information for legally- and ethically-structured analysis. We cannot assume that information related to identity is 'ours for the taking'. 

Please let me know if you/one of you would be willing to take part in this working group. It promises to be an important contribution to ADHO's continuing work, and I look forward to this challenge. 

If possible, could you let me know by 15 May if someone will participate, so that our work can proceed.

Best etc.
