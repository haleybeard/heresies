      <h5><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q106878856">Arlene Ladden</a></span></h5>The smile of my gracious lady makes me happier than if four hundred angels laughed
      at
      				me from the heavens (Raimbaut d'Orange, while some less gracious ladies chuckled
      				from the wings.)
      <p>The attitudes in True Romances (and in most of our pasts)
         				originally shone forth from 12th-century troubadour poetry and even then they
         were
         				a little tarnished. Chaste, idealistic and upper-ciass, medieval troubadour poetry
         				supposedly countered a strong tradition of misogyny. It also supposedly elevated
         				woman by upholding that same feminine mystique which, for centuries, the Christian
         				fathers had diligently) tried to demolish: “Corporeal beauty is nothing else but
         				phlegm, and blood, and humor, and bile, and the fluid of masticated food.... "
         said
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q43706">John Chrysostom</a>, a saint, in the 4th century. "When you see a rag with any of
         				these things on it, such as phlegm, or spittle, you cannot bear to touch it even
         				with the tips of your fingers. . . . Are you in a flutter of excitement about
         the
         				storehouses and depositories of these things?" </p>
      <p>Woman was so many layers of mucous membrane. And writings from 6 and 7 centuries
         				later attest to the muddy strides saints and clerics had taken in the interim:
         "If
         				her bowels and flesh were cut open, you would see what filth is covered by her
         white
         				skin. If a fine crimson cloth covered a pile of foul dung, would anyone be foolish
         				enough to love the dung because of it?"  Now, woman was simply so much manure
         				smattered across the coprophagous pages of Christian doctrine.</p>
      <p> The wheels of progress kept on turning. A 3th-century work addressed itself
         				specifically to women—three worthy recluses: "What fruit does your flesh yield
         from
         				all its openings?" began their catechism. “Between the taste of mouth and smell
         of
         				nose, aren’t there holes like two privy holes? Aren't you born of foul slime?
         Aren't
         				you worm-food?  To the Church, woman was simply full of shit. Yet this was the
         				legacy bequeathed to the Middle Ages where the love of woman was a cult—an absolute
         				prerequisite for respectability. And love flourished. Of course, misogyny
         				continued to flourish too. Woman would still be called "a stinking rose" and
         				"glittering mud” and “a temple built over a sewer."  But, as sister to Mary, she was
         				also the mystical elevator of the masculine soul which, by its nature, gravitated
         				toward perfection. By merely contemplating woman in her golden radiance, man could
         				rise to spiritual heights in a kind of "gilt” by association. For somewhere between
         				the muddy slime and the hazy castle spire, a new woman had been spawned. Like
         the
         				enchanted fay (fairy) of Celtic lore, she moved softly, gliding over but never
         				touching terra firma, surrounded by auras so fragile that they were better left
         				unpenetrated. But these were beautiful, mysterious and promising auras, and
         				scribes feverishly copied down the formulas for keeping them intact: "If you have
         				ugly teeth, don't laugh with your mouth open." "Practice making pretty speeches.
         “
         				"Dye your hair; wear false hair if you have lost your own." </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4340">Andreas Capellanus</a>, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q95795577">Jacques D'Amiens</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1774110">Robert le Blois</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1778218">Garin le Brun</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q54834439">Drouart la
            				Vache</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20922145">Ermangau</a> and <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2121581">de Fournival</a> —all added their instructions to the heap: Lie.
         				Cheat. Drop names, if you have to. Drop dead, if you have to. Anything.</p>
      <p> Maintaining the mystique was the important thing, and that meant keeping the
         				distance. It meant the ecstasy was in the wooing while sex lay in the winding
         down.
         				Even the ladies understood that attainment decreased their value, and many who
         				loftily kept their suitors well below thigh level would rather have had it
         				otherwise. After all, as even the ladies knew: a  lover is a vision
         				surrounded by auras. But flesh and blood is flesh and blood... and phlegm and
         dung
         				and mucous and bile and etc.</p>
      <p> Once woman ceased to be a symbol, she became a person, a passion, a robber of reason–a
         literal and metaphorical scum-bag.</p>
      <p> No wonder the ladies were afraid to submit. With submission, love and its raison
         				d'être became the discarded backdrop for a fait accompli. The love was no longer
         				ennobling (ergo: the animal soul pawed and dragged down its rational counterpart),
         				and the woman was no longer mounted on a pedestal (ergo: with the man on top,
         she
         				was mounted, period). And man’s desire—well, that often died along with his
         				suffering.</p>
      <p> It’s natural, then, that the really legendary lovers chose the most distant and
         				unattainable objects they couid conceive of. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3779564">Guilhem de la Tour</a>, for instance, loved
         				the woman he lived with.   Now such women were worn on everyday occasions and were
         				inevitably mundane. But Guilhem’s enamorata was unearthly; in fact, she was dead.
         On
         				the eve of her burial, Guilhem visited her grave and, after ten days of morbid
         				embracing and poignant conversation (she was a good listener), he went home firm
         in
         				the belief that she would rise from her tomb and come back to him. She didn't.
         But
         				for years, it was only Beatrix he longed for. She was the perfect lover—mystical
         				ethereal and unobtrusive. It was a passion that rivaled even Jaufre Rudel's.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5260">Jaufre Rudel</a> was ingenious. In an age which valued prolonged desire, he contrived a
         				wonderful device. He fell in love with the Countess of Tripoli—a woman he had
         				never seen but whose beauty had filled his imagination so enchantingly that
         				southern France became a glorious vantage point. And so it remained for several
         				years until, despite the protests of his friends and patron, he resolved at last
         to
         				cross the ocean to be near her. </p>
      <p>Maybe he just got sick. Or maybe, as his biographers prefer to believe, the
         				anticipation of seeing her was too much for his little heart to bear. In any case,
         				as the boat was approaching <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3579">Tripoli</a>, he apparently expired. But only apparently.
         				For as the countess rushed to his side, her presence revived him and he pronounced
         				himself fulfilled at last and died again in her arms— a self-extinction
         				metaphorically equivalent to orgasm, but which Jaufre seems to have taken much
         too
         				literally, since <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1401">Petrarch</a> and other chroniclers affirm that this time he actually
         				did die, and in all probability with his pants on.  </p>
      <p> True, Jaufre was a strange and nearly legendary breed. But while to him sex must
         				have seemed an unspeakable defilement, most were not so theoretical. Even
         				troubadours who constantly reminded women that sex was debasing and honor was
         all
         				had an ultimately sensua physicality in mind. Woman was like a fine wine. A man
         				twirls it about, observes its color, its clarity, savoring its bouquet and rolling
         				it around on his languishing taste-buds. And though the swallow is only the means
         to
         				the end, the end is still very definitely in view. Most pleas for chastity were
         only
         				lip-service. Even <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q665165">Sordello</a>, a troubadour who repeatedly swore he’d rather die than
         				see a lady even taint her honor, happened to kidnap a Veronese countess and that
         				didn’t help her honor a bit. Nor did it discredit his poetry. Such scandal was
         				irrelevant. In fact, women were irrelevant. Love was the important thing and the
         				trick was to keep it alive as long as possible, feeding it little by ever-so-little
         				in an extended and delicious tease. Men could nudge at the gates to the ovarian
         				fortress, but entrance, they knew should be delayed. The uitimate object was sex;
         				men wanted what they waited for. They just didn’t want it right away. And this
         				largely explains why other men’s wives proved such suitable candidates for
         				adoration. Forbidden, llicit, deliciously dangerous—yet slightly damaged, they
         				promised all the more to be ultimately affordable. They were perfectly fashioned
         for
         				desire.</p>
      <p> Desire is a tricky business. In Greece <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41523">Plutarch</a> had admired Spartan marriages
         				where, for years, man approached his wife in darkness in secret and in haste "so
         as
         				not to be satiated... there was still place for unextinguished desire."  It was a
         				useful formula and was later picked up in the Middle Ages when the notion of infre-
         				quent and clandestine meetings was embraced a lot more than the ladies were. The
         				medieval magic of love was uncertainty. Even the romances preserved this ideal.
         				The lady could be snatched away at any moment by a darkening scandal or a jealous
         				husband, or be absorbed into the ethers which spawned her disappearing into the
         				mist on a white palfrey. The knight wanted her like that: distant, pure, mysterious,
         virginal —a blonde Mary ascending into  heaven, looming over the
         				castle horizon with only a little soot on her feet suggesting that she didn’t
         belong
         				there.</p>
      <p> Never mind that the only pure-white creature was the post-menopausal albino
         				rabbit—or that even the ladies depicted in romance were potentially swivers of
         				heroic proportions. Since sex distinguished the distant fay from the dung-filled
         				floozy, relatively sexless love became prevalent, and many women—whether they
         liked
         				it or not—played along.</p>
      <p> There were advantages, of course. Love became a rare delicacy whereas before it
         				had been something like yesterday’s leftovers. As Ovid's classical formula goes:
         				"Pleasure coming slow is the best”;  meaning, the longer the foreplay the better the
         				orgasm; meaning, some courtly couples, when they finally did come, must very nearly
         				have blown their brains out.</p>
      <p> But some, for sure, were disappointed. Women were dropped, men bumbled like
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q728510">Perceval</a> or—like some knights in the bawdier tales— they'd win their ladies with
         				lots of pomp and peter out before they could even open the package, their worlds
         				ending not with a bang but a whimper. These were particularly grateful for courtly
         				love.</p>
      <p> Courtly love was a game of foreplay whose rule was often touch and go; it was an
         				answet (and a spur) to impotence. Some knights were barely post-pubescent and
         many
         				were sexually insecure, preferring rich expectations to poor reputations and
         				one-night stands. Better to tilt about the countryside, flaunting a passion and
         				flailing a sword (the sword had always been a metaphor for penis—"vagina” is merely
         				Latin or "sheath"), imagining a truly magnificent sexual prowess when the real
         thing
         				was maybe limp by comparison. Love by its very nature was a test, and knights
         were
         				afraid to take the exam. Or sometimes, it was better to put it off than to put
         it
         				in.</p>
      <p> Love became formalized. The knight waxed and grew pale, and waxed, and waxed, and
         				waxed. It was blissful and aggrandizing anticipation. Too bad if a lady sometimes
         				felt cheated—if watching her knight charging and gleaming, she secretly wished
         				hed get off his high horse and get down to business. What could the women do?
         Their
         				iron-clad men performed in the tournaments. Ramming, sweating, thrusting and
         				galloping. . . . Ah, those impervious men in the metal suits.</p>
      <p> ...The only things naked were their swords.</p>
