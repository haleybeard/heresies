      <h3 align="left">On Woman's Refusal to Celebrate Male Creativity</h3>
      <h5><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q85882229">Rivolta Femminile</a></h5>
      <p>We in Rivolta Femminile refuse to pay tribute
         				to male creativity because we are aware that in
         				the patriarchal world—that is, in a world made
         				by men and for men—even the liberating force of creativity is the prerogative
         of men. Woman—in so many ways a subsidiary being—is
         				denied every role which could effect à recognition of these inequities. For her,
         there is no
         				prospect of liberation.</p>
      <p>The creativity of men speaks to the creativity
         				of other men while woman, as client and spectator of that dialogue, is assigned
         a status which
         				excludes competition. Woman is locked into a
         				role which, a priori, assures the male artist an
         				audience. While creating art is seen to have a
         				liberating function, art as an institution insists
         				that woman be the neutral witness to the work
         				of others. Man’s energy, even in art, is spent by
         				competing with other men. Only the contemplation of art invites woman's involvement.</p>
      <p>This is the nature of patriarchal creativity: to
         				depend upon aggressive competition with male
         				rivals and on the passive appreciation of women. Man, the artist, feels abandoned
         by woman
         				as soon as she abandons her archetypal spectator's role; their mutual solidarity
         rests solely on
         					 the conviction that, as a spectator gratified by
         				creativity, woman reaches the highest possible
         				point in the evolution of her species.</p>
      <p>But, on the contrary, woman is discovering
         				that the patriarchal world needs her—that
         				man's self-liberating efforts absolutely depend
         				on her—and that woman's liberation can only
         				be realized independent of patriarchal previsions and the dynamics by which men
         liberate
         				themselves. The artist depends upon woman to
         				glorify his work and she, until she begins her
         				own liberation, is happy to oblige. The work of
         				art cannot afford to lose the security inherent in
         				her exclusively receptive role.</p>
      <p>Once aware of her position in relation to
         				male creativity, woman is left with two possibilities: the first—until now, the
         only available
         				option—of distinguishing herself within the creative hierarchy historically defined
         by men
         				(which alienates her from other women while
         				men recognize her only indulgently); or—the
         				feminist alternative—of autonomously recover
         				ing her own creativity, nourished by her awareness of past oppression.</p>
      <p>To celebrate male creativity is ultimately to
         				submit to the historic sovereignty of men, to
         				that patriarchal strategy which deliberately subjugates us. But let woman remove
         herself, and
         				the struggle for male supremacy becomes not
         				man lording it over woman, but merely a struggle between individual men.</p>
      <p>By refusing to celebrate male creativity, we
         				are not judging creativity, nor are we contesting
         				it. Rather, with our absence, we are refusing to
         				accept it as defined; we are challenging the
         				concept of art as something which men graciously hand down to us. By ceasing to
         believe
         				in a refracted liberation, we are unleashing
         				creative energy from patriarchal bonds.</p>
      <p>With her absence, woman performs a dramatic act of awareness, creative because it
         is liberating.
