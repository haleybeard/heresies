      <h3 align="left">Toward Socialist Feminism</h3>
      <h5><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q283659">Barbara Ehrenreich</a></h5>
      <p> At some level, perhaps not too well articulated, socialist feminism has been around
         				for a long time. You are a woman in a capitalist society. You get pissed off:
         about
         				the job, about the bills, about your husband (or ex), about the kids' school,
         the
         				housework, being pretty, not being pretty, being looked at, not being looked at
         (and
         				either way, not listened to), etc. If you think about all these things and how
         they
         				fit together and what has to be changed, and then you look around for some words
         to
         				hold all these thoughts together in abbreviated form, you'd almost have to come
         up
         				with something like "<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2420666">socialist feminism</a>." </p>
      <p>A lot of us came to socialist feminism in just that way: we were reaching for a
         				word/term/ phrase that would begin to express all of our concerns, all of our
         				principles in a way that neither "socialist" nor "feminist" seemed to. I have
         to
         				admit that most socialist feminists know are not too happy with the term "socialist
         				feminist" either. On the one hand it is too long (l have no hopes for a hyphenated
         				mass movement); on the other hand it is much too short for what is, after all,
         				really socialist internationalist anti-racist anti-heterosexist feminism.</p>
      <p>The trouble with taking a new label of any kind is that it creates an instant aura
         of
         				sectarianism. "Socialist feminism" becomes a challenge, a mystery, an issue in
         and
         				of itself. We have speakers, conferences, articles on "socialist feminism"—though
         we
         				know perfectly well that either"socialism" or "feminism" is too huge and too
         				inclusive to be a subject for any sensible speech, conference, or article. People,
         				including avowed socialist feminists, ask themselves anxiously, "What is socialist
         				feminism?" There is a kind of expectation that it is (or is about to be at any
         				moment, maybe in the next speech, conference or article) a brilliant synthesis
         of
         				world historical proportions—an evolutionary leap beyond <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9061">Marx</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9215">Freud</a> and
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101638">Wollstonecraft</a>. Or that it will turn out to be nothing, a fad seized on by a few
         				disgruntied feminists and female socialists, a temporary distraction.</p>
      <p>I want to try to cut through some of the mystery which has grown up around socialist
         				feminism. Here I am going to focus on our "theory"—the way we look at and analyze
         				the world. I am not going to deal with our total outlook as socialist feminists
         				because I want to stick as closely as possible to the interface of the two main
         				traditions we grow out of—socialism and feminism. </p>
      <p> A logical way to start is to look at socialism and feminism separately. How does
         a
         				socialist—more precisely a <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12716775">Marxist</a>—look at the world? How does a <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34074720">feminist</a> look at
         				the world? To begin with, Marxism and feminism have something important in common:
         				they are critical ways of looking at the world. Both rip away popular mythology
         and
         				"common-sense wisdom“ and force us to look at experience in a new way. Both seek
         to
         				understand the world—not in terms of static balances and symmetries (as in
         				conventional social science), but in terms of antagonisms. So they lead to
         				conclusions which are jarring and disturbing at the same time that they are
         				liberating. There is no way to have a Marxist or a feminist outlook and remain
         a
         				spectator. To understand the reality laid bare by these analyses is to move into
         				action to change it.</p>
      <p>Here I am going to restrict myself to what I see as the core insights of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7264">Marxism</a> and
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7252">feminism</a>, and state these as briefly and starkly as possible: Marxism (in 20 words
         				or less) addresses itself to the class dynamics of capitalist society. Every social
         				scientist knows that capitalist societies are characterized by more or less severe,
         				systemic inequality. Marxism understands this inequality to arise from processes
         				which are intrinsic to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6206">capitalism</a> as an economic system. A minority of people (the
         				capitalist class) own all the factories/ energy sources/resources on which everyone
         else depends in order to live. The great majority (the working class) must, out
         				of sheer necessity work, under conditions set by the capitalists, for the wages
         the
         				capitalists pay. Since the capitalists make their profits by paying less in wages
         				than the value of what the workers actually produce, the relationship between
         				these two classes is necessarily one of irreconcilable antagonism: the capitalist
         				class owes its very existence to the continued exploitation of the working class.
         				What maintains this system of class rule is, in the last analysis, force. The
         				capitalist class controls (directly or indirectiy) the means of organized violence
         				represented by the state—policemen, jails, etc. Only by waging a revolutionary
         				struggle aimed at the seizure of state power can the working class free itself,
         and,
         				ultimately, all people.</p>
      <p>Feminism addresses itself to another familiar inequality. All human societies are
         				marked by some degree of inequality between the sexes. If we survey human societies
         				at a glance, sweeping through history and across continents, we see that they
         have
         				commonly been characterizedby: the subjugation of women to male
         				authority, both within the family and in the community in general; the
         				objectification of women as a form of property; a sexual division of labor in
         which
         				women are confined to such activities as childraising, performing personal services
         				for adult males and specified (usually low-prestige) forms of productive labor.
         				Feminists, struck by the near-universality of these things have looked for
         				explanations in the biological "givens“ which underlie all human social existence:
         				men are physically stronger than women on the average, especially compared to
         				pregnant women or women who are nursing babies. Furthermore, men have the power
         to
         				make women pregnant. Thus the forms that sexual inequality takes—however various
         				they may be from culture to culture—rest, in the last analysis, on what is clearly
         a
         				physical advantage males hold over females. That is to say, they rest on violence,
         				or the threat of violence.</p>
      <p>The ancient, biological roots of male supremacy—the fact of male violence—are
         				commonly obscured by the laws and conventions which regulate the relations between
         				the sexes in any particular culture. But they are there, according to a feminist
         				analysis. The possibility of male assault stands as a constant warning to "bad"
         				(rebellious aggressive) women, and drives "good" women into complicity with male
         				supremacy. The reward for being "good" ("pretty," submissive) is protection from
         				random male violence and, in some cases, economic security.</p>
      <p>I hope I have written these capsule summaries of Marxism and feminism in such a way
         				that some similarities of approach show through. Marxism rips away the myths about
         "democracy" and "pluralism" to reveal a system of class rule that rests on forcible
         				exploitation. Feminism cuts through myths about "instinct" and romantic love to
         				expose male rule as a rule of force. Both analyses compel us to look at a
         				fundamental injustice. If either, or both, make you uncomfortable, they were meant
         				to! The choice is to reach for the comfort of the myths or as Marx put it, to
         work
         				for a social order which does not require myths to sustain it. Having gone to
         the
         				trouble to provide these thumbnail sketches of Marxism and feminism, the obvious
         				thing to do would be just to add them up and call the sum "socialist feminism."
         In
         				fact, this is probably how most socialist feminists operate most of the time—as
         a
         				kind of hybrid, pushing feminism in socialist circles, socialism in feminist
         				circles. Practically speaking, I think this is a perfectly reasonable way to
         				operate a lot of the time. One trouble with leaving things like that, though,
         is
         				that it keeps people wondering "Well, what is she really?" or demanding of us
         "What
         				is the principal contradiction?" Such questions often stop us in our tracks: It
         				sounds so compelling and authoritative and logical: "Make a choice! Be one or
         				another!" Yet we know that there is a political consistency to socialist feminism.
         				We are not hybrids or fence-sitters.</p>
      <p>To get to that political consistency we have to go beyond the capsule versions of
         				Marxism and feminism I laid out. We have to differentiate ourselves, as feminists
         				from other kinds of feminists, and as Marxists from other kinds of Marxists. We
         have
         				to stake out a socialist feminist kind of feminism and a socialist feminist kind
         				of socialism. Only then is there a possibility that things will "add up" to
         				something more than an uneasy juxtaposition. </p>
      <p> First, what is our outlook as feminists and how is it different from that of other
         				feminists? I think most radical feminists and socialist feminists would agree
         with
         				my capsule characteriza- tion of feminism as far as it goes. The trouble with
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2914207">radical feminism</a> from a socialist feminist point of view, is that it doesn’t go any
         				farther: it remains transfixed by the universality of male supremacy: things have
         				never really changed; all social systems are "patriarchies“; imperialism,
         				militarism and capitalism are all simply expressions of innate male aggressiveness.
         				And so on. </p>
      <p>The problem with this is not only that it leaves out men (and the possibility of
         				reconciliation with them on a truly human and egalitarian basis) but that it leaves
         				out an awful lot about women. For example to discount a socialist country such
         as
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29520">China</a> as a "patriarchy"—as have heard some radical feminists do—is to ignore the
         				real struggles and achievements of millions of women. Socialist feminists while
         				agreeing that there is something timeless and universal about women's oppression,
         				have insisted that it takes different forms in different settings, and that the
         				differences are of vital importance. There is a difference between a society in
         				which sexism is expressed by female infanticide and a society in which sexism
         takes
         				the form of unequal representation on the Central Committee. And the difference
         is
         				worth dying for. </p>
      <p>One of the historical variations on the theme of sexism which ought to concern all
         				feminists is the set of changes that came with the transition from an agrarian
         				society to industrial capitalism. This is no academic issue. The social system
         				which industrial capitalism replaced was in fact a patriarchal one, and I am using
         				that term now in its original sense to mean a system in which production is centered
         				in the household and is presided over by the oldest male. The fact is that
         				industrial capitalism came along and tore the rug out from under that system:
         				production went into the factories; individuals broke off from the family to become
         				"free" wage earners. To say that capitalism disrupted the patriarchal organization
         				of production and family life is not, of course, to say that capital- ism abolished
         				male supremacy! But the particularforms of sex oppression we
         				experience today are, to a significant degree, recent developments. A huge
         				historical discontinuity lies between us and true patriarchy. If we are to
         				understand our experience as women today, we must move beyond the biological
         				invariants of human experience to a consideration of capitalism as a system. </p>
      <p>There are other ways I could have gotten to the same point. I could have said simply
         				that as feminists we are most interested in the most oppressed women—poor and
         				working-class women, third-world women—and for that reason we are led to a need
         				to comprehend and confront captialism. I could have said that we need to address
         				ourselves to the class system simply because women are members of classes But
         I am
         				trying to bring out something else about our perspective: that there is no way
         to
         				understand sexism as it acts on our lives—never mind class oppression for a
         				minute—without putting it in the historical context of capitalism. </p>
      <p>Now let'cs go on to our outlook as Marxists. Again, I think most socialist feminists
         				would agree with my capsule summary as far as it goes. And the trouble again is
         that
         				there are a lot of people (I'll call them "mechanical Marxists") who do not go
         any
         				further. To these people, the only "real" and important things that go on in
         				capitalist society are those that relate to the productive process or the conventional
         political sphere. From such a point of view, every other part of experience
         				and social existence—education, sexuality, recreation, the family, art, music,
         				housework (you name it)—is peripheral to the central dynamics of social change;
         it
         				is part of the "superstructure" or "culture."</p>
      <p>Socialist feminists are in a very different camp. We (along with many Marxists who
         				are not feminists) see capitalism as a social and cultural totality. We understand
         				that, in its search for markets, capitalism is driven to penetrate every nook
         and
         				cranny of social existence. Especially in the monopoly capitalism phase, the realm
         				of consumption is every bit as important, just from an economic point of view
         as the
         				realm of production. So we cannot understand class struggle as something confined
         				to issues of wages and hours, or confined only to workplace issues. Class struggle
         				occurs in every arena where the interests of the classes conflict, and that includes
         				education, health, the arts, etc. We aim to transform not only the ownership of
         				the means of production, but the totality of social existence.</p>
      <p>So, as Marxists, we come to feminism from a completely different place than the
         				"mechanical Marxists." Because we see monopoly capitalism as a
         				political/economic/cultural totality, we have room within our Marxist framework
         for
         				feminist issues which have nothing ostensibly to do with production or "politics
         "
         				issues that have to do with "private" life. </p>
      <p> Furthermore, in our brand of Marxism, there is no "woman question," no big mystery
         				about women—because we never compartmentalized women off to the "superstructure“
         in
         				the first place. Marxists of a mechanical bent continually ponder the issue of
         the
         				unwaged woman (the housewife): is she really a member of the working class? That
         				is, does she really produce surplus value? We say, of course housewives are
         				members of the working class—not because we have some elaborate proof that they
         				really do produce surplus value–but because we understand a class as being
         				composed of people, and as having a social existence quite apart from the
         				capitalist-dominated realm of production. When we think of class in this way,
         then
         				we see that in fact the women who seemed most peripheral the housewives are at
         the
         				very heart of their class—raising children, holding together families, maintaining
         				the culture and social networks of the community. So we are coming out of a kind
         of
         				feminism and a kind of Marxism whose interests quite naturally flow together.
         I
         				think we are in a position now to see why it is that socialist feminism has been
         				such a great mystery. It is a paradox only as long as what you mean by socialism
         is
         				really "mechanical Marxism" and what you mean by feminism is an ahistorical kind
         of
         				radical feminism. These things don’t add up; they have nothing in common. But
         if
         				you put together another kind of socialism and another kind of feminism, as I
         have
         				tried to define them, you do get some common ground. And that is one of the most
         				important things about socialist feminism today: that it is a space—free from
         the
         				constrictions of a truncated kind of feminism and a truncated version of Marxism—a
         				space in which we can develop the kind of politics that address the political/
         				economic/cultural totality of monopoly capitalist society. We could go only so
         far
         				with the available feminisms, the conventional Marxism, and then we had to break
         out
         				to something that is not so restrictive and so incomplete in its view of the world.
         				We had to take a new name, socialist feminism," in order to assert our determination
         to comprehend the whole of our experience and to forge a politics that
         				reflects the totality of that comprehension. At that I may have fulfilled my mission
         				of demystifying socialist feminism, but I don't want to leave this theory as a
         				"space" or a common ground. Things are beginning to grow in that ground. We are
         				closer to a synthesis in our understanding of sex and class capitalism and male
         				domination, than we were a few years ago. Here l will indicate very sketchily
         one
         				such line of thought:</p>1. The Marxist/feminist understanding that class and sex domination rest
      					"ultimately" on force is correct, and this remains the most devastating critique
      					of sexist/capitalist society. But there is a lot to that "ultimately." In a  day-to-day sense, most people acquiesce to sex and class domination
      					without being held in line by the threat of violence, and often without even
      the
      					threat of material deprivation. 2. It is very important, then, to figure out what, if not the direct
      					application of force, keeps things going. In the case of class a great deal has
      					been written already about why the American working class lacks militant class
      					consciousness. Certainly ethnic divisions especially the Black/white division,
      					are a key to the answer. But, I would argue, in addition to being divided, the
      					working class has been socially atomized: working-class neighborhoods have been
      					destroyed and allowed to decay; life has become increasingly privatized and
      					inward-looking; skills once possessed by the working class have been
      					expropriated by the capitalist class; capitalist-controlled "mass culture“ has
      					edged out almost all indigenous working-class culture and institutions. Instead
      					of collectivity and self-reliance as a class there is mutual isolation and
      					collective dependency on the capitalist class. 3. The subjugation of women, in ways characteristic of late capitalist
      					society, has been a key to this process of class atomization. To put it another
      					way: the forces which have atomized working-class life and promoted cultural/material
      dependency on the capitalist class are the same forces which have
      					served to perpetuate the subjugation of women. It is women who are most
      					isolated in what has become an increasingly privatized family existence (even
      					when they work outside the home too). It is, in many instances women's skills
      					(productive skills, healing, midwifery) which have been discredited or banned
      					to make way for commodities. It is, above all, women who are required to be
      					utterly passive/uncritical/dependent (i.e. "feminine") in the face of the
      					pervasive capitalist penetration of private life. Historically, late capitalist
      					penetration of working-class life has singled out women as prime targets of
      					pacification (or "feminization") because women are the culture-bearers of their
      					class. 4. It follows that there is a fundamental interconnectedness between women's
      					struggle and what is traditionally conceived as class struggle. Not all women's
      					struggles have an inherently anti-capitalist thrust (particularly not those
      					which seek only to advance the power and wealth of special groups of women),
      but
      					all those which build collectivity and collective confidence among women are
      					vitally important to the building of class consciousness. Conversely, not all
      					class struggles have an inherently anti-sexist thrust (especially not those
      					which cling to pre-industrial patriarchal values) but all those which seek to
      					build the social and cultural autonomy of the working class are necessarily
      					linked to the struggle for women's liberation.
      <p>This is one direction which socialist feminist analysis is taking. No one is
         				expecting a synthesis to emerge which will collapse socialist and feminist struggles
         				into the same thing. The capsule summaries I gave earlier retain their "ultimate"
         				truth: there are crucial aspects of capitalist domination (such as racial
         				oppression) which a purely feminist perspective simply cannot account for or deal
         				with—without bizarre distortions, that is. There are crucial aspects of sex
         				oppression (such as male violence within the family) into which socialist thought
         				has little insight—again without a lot of stretching and distortion. Hence the
         need
         				to continue to be socialists and feminists. But there is enough of a synthesis,
         both
         				in what we think and what we do, for us to begin to develop a self-confident
         				identity as socialist feminists. </p>
