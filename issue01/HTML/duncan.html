      <h3 align="left">The Esthetics of Power in Modern Erotic Art</h3>
      <h5><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42564192">Carol Duncan</a></h5>
      <p> In this essay, I am using the term erotic not as a self-evident, universal category,
         				but as a culturally defined concept that is ideological in nature. More
         				specifically, I am arguing that the modern art that we have learned to recognize
         and
         				respond to as erotic is frequently about the power and supremacy of men over women.
         				Indeed, once one begins to subject erotic art to critical analysis, to examine
         the
         				male-female relationships it implies, one is struck with the repetitiousness with
         				which the issue of power is treated. The erotic imaginations of modern male
         				artists—the famous and the forgotten, the formal innovators and the
         				followers—re-enact in hundreds of particular variations a remarkably limited set
         of
         				fantasies. Time and again, the male confronts the female nude as an adversary
         whose
         				independent existence as a physical or spiritual being must be assimilated to
         male
         				needs, converted to abstractions, enfeebled or destroyed. So often do such works
         				invite fantasies of male conquest (or fantasies that justify male domination)
         that
         				the subjugation of the female will appear to be one of the primary motives of
         				modern erotic art.</p>
      <p>In <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33477">Delacroix'</a>s <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q19015135"><a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010064041#">Woman in White Stockings</a></a> (1832), for example, an artist's model (i.e.,
         				a sexually available woman) reclines invitingly on a silken mattress. The deep
         red
         				drapery behind her forms a shadowy and suggestive opening. The image evokes a
         basic
         				male fantasy of sexual confrontation, but the model does not appear to anticipate
         				pleasure. On the contrary, she appears to be in pain, and the signs of her distress
         				are depicted as carefully as her alluring flesh. Her face, partly averted, appears
         				disturbed, her torso is uncomfortably twisted, and the position of her arms suggests
         				surrender and powerlessness. But this distress does not contradict the promise
         of
         				male gratification. Rather, it is offered as an explicit condition of male
         				pleasure—the artist's and the viewer's.</p>
      <p>The equation of female sexual experience with surrender and victimization is so
         				familiar in what our culture designates as erotic art and so sanctioned by both
         				popular and high cultural traditions, that one hardly stops to think it odd. The
         				Victorian myth that women experience sex as a violation of body or spirit or both,
         				and that those who actively seek gratification are perverse (and hence deserving
         of
         				degradation), is but one of many ideological justifications of the sexual
         				victimization of women devised by the modern era. In the 20th century, the theory
         				and practice of psychology has given new rationalizations to the same underlying
         				thesis.</p>
      <p>The visual arts are crowded with images of suffering, exposed heroines—slaves, murder
         				victims, women in terror under attack, betrayed, in chains, abandoned or abducted.
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33477">Delacroix</a>'s <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1133821">Death of Sardanapalus</a> (1827), inspired by a poem by <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5679"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5679">Byron</a></a>, is a tour de
         				force of erotic cruelty. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23380">Ingres</a>' <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3439636">Roger and Angelica</a> (1867) also depicts woman as
         				victim. Here, an endangered and helpless heroine—naked, hairless and swooning—is
         				chained to a large, phallic-shaped rock, immediately below which appear the
         				snake-like forms of a dragon. This fantastic but deadly serious statement documents
         				a common case of male castration anxiety. But the artist-hero (he is Ingres-Roger)
         				masters the situation: he conquers the dangerous female genitals. First he
         				desexualizes Angelica—reduces her to an unconscious mass of closed and boneless
         				flesh; then he thrusts his lance into the toothy opening of the serpent—Angelica's
         				vagina transposed. Given the fears such an image reveals, it is no wonder that
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23380">Ingres</a> idealized helpless, passive women. The point here, however, is that neither
         				Ingres' fears nor his ideal woman were unique to him.</p>
      <p>Americans, too, thrilled to images of female victims. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2572996">Hiram Power</a>'s <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3203228"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3203228">The Greek Slave</a></a>
         				(1843) was probably the most famous and celebrated American sculpture in the
         				mid-19th century. Overtly, the viewer could admire the virtuous modesty with which
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2572996">Powers</a> endowed the young slave girl, as did critics in the 19th century; but
         				covertly, Powers invites the viewer to imagine himself as the potential oriental
         				buyer of a beautiful, naked, humiliated girl who is literally for sale (he specified
         				that she is on the auction block). The narrative content of this sculpture supports
         				the same underlying thesis we saw in the Delacroix: for women, the sexual encounter
         				must entail pain and subjugation, and that subjugation is a condition of male
         				gratification. But even in paintings where nudes are not literally victims, female
         				allure is treated in terms related to victimization. For Ingres, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34618"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34618">Courbet</a></a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39931"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39931">Renoir</a></a>,
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5589"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5589">Matisse</a></a> and scores of other modern artists, weakness, mindlessness and indolence are
         				attributes of female 'sexiness. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q103591">Germaine Greer</a>'s description of the female ideal
         				that informs modern advertising could as well have been drawn from modern nudes:
         </p>Her essential quality is castratedness. She absolutely must be young, her body
      				hairless, her flesh buoyant, and she must not have a sexual organ.
      <p>That is, in the modern era, woman's desirability increases as her humanity and health
         				(relative to male norms) are diminished.</p>
      <p>The need to see women as weak, vapid, unhealthy objects-—while not unique to the
         				modern era—is evidently felt with unusual intensity and frequency in bourgeois
         				civilization, whose technical advances so favor the idea of sexual equality. Indeed,
         				as women's claims to full humanity grew the more relentlessly would art rationalize
         				their inferior status. For while literature and the theatre could give expression
         to
         				feminist voices, the art world acknowledged only male views of human sexual
         				experience. In that arena, men alone were free to grapple with their sexual
         				aspirations, fantasies and fears. Increasingly in the modern era, artists and
         their
         				audiences agreed that serious and profound art is likely to be about what men
         think
         				of women. In fact, the defense of male supremacy must be recognized as a central
         				theme in modern art. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37693">Gauguin</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41406">Munch</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q30755">Rodin</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5589">Matisse</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5593">Picasso</a> and scores of other
         				artists, consciously or unconsciously, identified some aspect of the sexist cause
         				with all or part of their own artistic missions. Art celebrating sexist experience
         				was accorded the greatest prestige, given the most pretentious esthetic rationales
         				and identified with the highest and deepest of human aspirations.</p>
      <p>Nudes and whores—women with no identity beyond their existence as sex objects—were
         				made to embody transcendent, "universally significant statements. In literature
         as
         				in art, the image of the whore even came to stand for woman in her purest, most
         				concentrated form, just as the brothel became the ultimate classroom, the temple
         in
         				which men only might glimpse life's deepest mysteries: "A Henry Miller, going
         to bed
         				with a prostitute [in Tropic of Cancer], feels that he sounds the very depths
         of
         				life, death and the cosmos."  Picasso's famous brothel scene, the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q910199">Demoiselles d’Avignon</a>
         				(1907), where the viewer is cast as the male customer makes similar claims—claims
         				that art historians advocate as "humanistic“ and universal. Art-making itself is analogous to the sexual domination of
         				whores. The metaphor of the penis-as-paintbrush is a revered truth for many
         				20th-century artists and art historians. It also insists that to create is to
         				possess, to dominate, and to be quintessentially male.</p>I try to paint with my heart and my loins, not bothering with style
      				(Vlaminck).Thus I learned to battle the canvas, to come to know it as a being resisting my
      				wish (dream), and to bend it forcibly to this wish. At first it stands there like
      a
      				pure chaste virgin and then comes the willful brush which first here, then there,
      				gradually conquers it with all the energy peculiar to it, like a European colonist
      				...(Kandinsky).
      <p>The kind of nudes that prevail in the modern era do not merely reflect a collective
         				male psyche. They actively promote the relationships they portray, not only
         				expressing but also shaping sexual consciousness. For the nude, in her passivity
         and
         				impotence, is addressed to women as much as to men. Far from being merely an
         				entertainment for males, the nude, as a genre, is one of many cultural phenomena
         				that teaches women to see themselves through male eyes and in terms of dominating
         				male interests. While it sanctions and reinforces in men the identification of
         				virility with domination, it holds up to women self-images in which even sexual
         				self-expression is prohibited. As ideology, the nude shapes our awareness of our
         				deepest human instincts in terms of domination and submission so that the supremacy
         				of the male "I" prevails on that most fundamental level of experience.</p>
      <p>Twentieth-century art has equally urged the victimization and spiritual diminution
         of
         				women, shedding, however the narrative trappings and much of the illusionism of
         the
         				19th century. The abandoned Ariadnes, endangered captives and cloistered harem
         women
         				of 19th century art become simply naked models and mistresses in the studio or
         whores
         				in the brothel. In nudes by Matisse, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q241098"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q241098">Vlaminck</a></a>, <span style="font-style:italic"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q229272">Kirchner</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15485083">Van Dongen</a></span> and others, the
         				demonstration of male control and the suppression of female subjectivity is more
         				emphatic and more frequently asserted than in 19th-century ones. Their faces are
         				more frequently concealed, blank or mask-like (that is when they are not put to
         				sleep), and the artist manipulates their passive bodies with more liberty and
         				"artistic" bravado than ever. </p>
      <p> The image of the femme fatale, especially popular at the turn of the century, would
         				seem to contradict the image of woman as victim. Typically, she looms over the
         male
         				viewer, fixing him with a mysterious gaze and rendering him will-less. Yet she
         is
         				born of the same set of underlying fears as her powerless, victimized sisters,
         as
         				the depictions often reveal. Munch's Madonna (1893-94), a femme fatale par excellence,
         visually hints at the imagery of victimization. The familiar gestures of
         				surrender (the arm behind the head) and captivity (the arm behind the back, as
         if
         				bound) are clearly if softly stated. These gestures have a long history in Western
         				art. The dying Daughter of Niobe, a well-known Greek sculpture of the 5th century
         				B.C. exhibits exactly this pose. The raised arm is also seen in numerous 5th-century
         				statues of dying Amazons and sleeping Ariadnes, where it conveys death, sleep
         or an
         				overwhelming of the will. It may also convey the idea of lost struggle, as in
         the
         				Amazon statues or in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5592">Michaelangelo</a>'s Dying Captive (<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q19675">The Louvre</a>), themselves
         				masterpieces of victim imagery with strong sexual overtones. But in the modern
         era,
         				the raised arm (or arms) is emptied of its classical connotation of defeat with
         				dignity and becomes almost exclusively a female gesture—a signal of sexual surrender
         				and physical availability. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41406">Munch</a> used it in his Madonna to mitigate his assertion of
         				female power; the gesture of defeat subtly checks the dark, overpowering force
         of
         				Woman. The same ambivalence can also be seen in the spatial relationship between
         the
         				figure and the viewer: the woman can be read as rising upright before him or as
         				lying beneath him.</p>
      <p>However lethal to the male, the late 19th-century femme fatale of Munch, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34661"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34661">Klimt</a></a> and
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q203828"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q203828">Moreau</a></a> ensnares by her physical beauty and sexual allure. In the 20th century, she
         				becomes bestial, carnivorous and visibly grotesque. In images of monstrous females
         				by <span style="font-style:italic">Picasso, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q156128">Rouault</a></span>, the Surrealists and <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/4234160486149205180008/"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q103853809">de Kooning</a></a>, the dread of woman and male
         				feelings of inferiority are projected, objectified and universalized. Yet here
         too
         				the devouring woman implies her opposite, combining features of both the powerless
         				and the threatening. The women in Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon, although
         				physically mutilated and naked (vulnerable), aggressively stare down the viewer
         are
         				impenetrably masked, and display sharp-edged, dangerous-looking bodies. Picasso
         				ambivalently presents them with sham and real reverence in the form of a desecrated,
         				burlesque icon, already slashed to bits. De Kooning, in his continuing Woman
         				series, ritually invokes, objectifies and obliterates the same species of
         				goddess-whore. Here too a similar ambivalence finds its voice in shifting, unstable
         				forms whose emergence and destruction are accepted in the critical literature
         as the
         				conscious "esthetic" pretext for his work. The pose his figures usually take—
         a
         				frontal crouch with thighs open to expose the vulva—also appears in the Demoiselles
         				d'Avignon (in the lower right figure), which, in turn, derives from primitive
         art.
         				Like Picasso's figures, de Kooning's women are simultaneously inviting and
         				repelling, above and below the viewer obscene modern whores and terrifying primitive
         				deities.</p>
      <p>The pronounced teeth in de Kooning's <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q64514216">Woman and Bicycle</a> (1950)—the figure actually has
         				a second set around her throat—also speak of primitive and modern neurotic fears
         of
         				the female genitals. The vagina dentata, an ancient fantasy into which males project
         				their terror of castration—of being swallowed up or devoured in their partner's
         				sexual organs—is commonly represented as a toothed mouth. The image, which appears
         				frequently in modern art, is a striking feature of Mirö's Woman's Head (1938).
         The
         				savage creature in this painting has open alligator jaws protruding from a large,
         				black head. The red eye, bristling hairs and exaggerated palpable nipples, in
         				combination with the thin weak arms, help give it that same mixture of comic
         				improbability and terribleness that characterize Picasso's Demoiselles and de
         				Kooning's Women. But in addition—and true to Mirö's love of metamorphosing forms—the
         				image can be read literally as the lower part of a woman’s body, seen partly as
         if
         				through an X ray. Inverted, the arms become open legs, the dark, massive head
         a
         				uterus, and the long, dangerous jaws a toothed vaginal canal. The predatory creature
         				in Picasso's <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3632880">Seated Bather</a> (1929) not only has saw-toothed jaws, but several
         				features of the praying mantis.</p>
      <p>The praying mantis, who supposedly devours her mate, was a favorite theme in
         				Surrealist art and literature. In paintings by <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q312529"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q312529">Masson</a></a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q103946282"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2012984">Labisse</a></a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q154842"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q154842">Ernst</a></a> and others,
         				the cannibalistic sexual rites of this insect become a metaphor for the human
         sexual
         				relationship, and the female of the species  becomes the Surrealistic version of the
         				femme fatale. More subhuman and brutal than her 19th-century predecessors, she
         				testifies to the higher level of sexual anxiety and hostility experienced by the
         				20th-century male. For as women increasingly demanded a share of the world, the
         				defense of male authority became more desperate:</p>Now become a fellow being, woman seems as formidable as when she faced man as a
      				part of alien Nature. In place of the myth of the laborious honeybee or the mother
      				hen is substituted the myth of the devouring female insect: the praying mantis,
      the
      				spider. No longer is the female she who nurses the little ones, but rather she
      who
      				eats the male.
      <p>Pictures of nudes in nature also affirm the supremacy of the male consciousness even
         				while they ostensibly venerate or pay tribute to women as freer or more in harmony
         				with nature than men. From the Bathers of Delacroix to those of Renoir and Picasso
         				nude-in-nature pictures almost always ascribe to women a mode of existence that
         is
         				categorically different from man's. Woman is seen as more of nature than man,
         less
         				in opposition to it both physically and mentally. Implicitly, the male is seen
         as
         				more closely identified with culture, "the means by which humanity transcends
         the
         				givens of natural existence, bends them to its purposes, controls them in its
         					interests."</p>
      <p>This woman/nature-man/culture dichotomy is one of the most ancient and universal
         				ideas ever devised by man and is hardly new to modern Western culture. However,
         in
         				Western bourgeois culture, the real and important role of women in domestic,
         				economic and social life becomes ever more recognized: increasingly, the bourgeoisie
         				educates its daughters, depends upon their social and economic cooperation and
         				values their human companionship. Above all, the idea that women belong to the
         same
         				order of being as men is more articulated than ever before. In this context, to
         				cling to ancient notions of women as a race apart from men—as creatures of nature
         				rather than of culture—is to defend blatantly an ideology that is everywhere
         				contested and contradicted by experience. Nevertheless, the majority of nude-in-nature
         pictures state just this thesis.</p>
      <p>In countless 19th- and 20th-century paintings—Romantic, Symbolist or
         				Expressionist—female nudes in outdoor settings are treated as natural inhabitants
         of
         				the landscape. Although modern artists have characterized it differently, they
         agree
         				that this woman-nature realm is an inviting but alien mode of experience. It both
         				attracts and repels the male. It beckons him to step out of rationalized, bourgeois
         				society and to enter a world where men might live through their senses instincts
         or
         				imaginations. But the condition of entry—shedding the social identity of the
         				bourgeois male—also entails loss of autonomy and of the power to shape and control
         				one's world. The male artist longs to join those naked beings in that other imagined
         				realm, but he cannot because he fails to imagine their full humanity—or his own.
         				While he values his own instincts, or that part of himself that responds to nature,
         				he regards this portion of his nature as feminine," antagonistic to his socialized
         				masculine ego and belonging to that other "natural" order. Nor can he acknowledge
         in
         				women a "masculine principle"—an autonomous self that knows itself as separate
         from
         				and opposed to the natural, biological world. Like Munch before his Madonna, he
         				hovers before his dream in ambivalent desire.</p>
      <p>Rarely do modern artists imagine naked men in that other realm. When they do, as in
         				works by <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q35548"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q35548">Cézanne</a></a> or Kirchner, the male figures tend to look uncomfortable or
         				self-conscious. More often, the male in nature is clothed—both in the literal
         sense
         				or metaphorically—with a social identity and a social or cultural project. He
         is a
         				shepherd, a hunter an artist. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5589">Matisse</a>'s <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20890797">Boy With Butterfly Net</a> (1907) is a
         				magnificent image of a male in nature (or rather a male acting against nature),
         				highly individualized and properly equipped for a specific purpose. In beach scenes
         				by the <span style="font-style:italic">Fauves</span> and the Kirchner circle, males—when they are present—are not "bathers"
         				i.e., placid creatures of the water, but modern men going swimming in bathing
         suits
         				or in the raw. They are active, engaged in a culturally defined recreation, located
         				in historical time and space. The female bather who has no counterpart in modern
         				art, is a naked existence, outside of culture. <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/7150159248527604870001/">Michelet,</a> the 19th-century historian,
         				poetically expressed the ideas implicit in the genre: man, he wrote, creates
         				history, while woman: </p>follows the noble and serene epic that Nature chants in her harmonious cycles,
      				repeating herself with a touching grace of constancy and fidelity. .. . Nature
      is a
      				woman. History, which we very foolishly put in the feminine gender, is a rude,
      				savage male, a sun-burnt, dusty traveller... 
      <p>Even in Matisse’s Joy of Living (1906), where men and women share an Arcadian life,
         				cultural activities (music-making, animal husbandry) are male endeavors while
         women
         				exist merely as sensual beings or abandon themselves to emotionally expressive
         but
         				artless and spontaneous dance.</p>
      <p>How we relate to these works becomes a compelling issue once their sexual-political
         				content is apparent. The issue, however, is difficult to grasp without first coming
         				to terms with the ideological character of our received notions of art. For in
         our
         				society, art—along with all high culture—has replaced religion (that is, among
         the
         				educated) as the repository of what we are taught to regard as our highest, most
         				enduring values. As sanctified a category as any our society offers, art silently
         				but ritually validates and invests with mystifying authority the ideals that sustain
         				existing social relations. In art, those ideals are given to us as general,
         				universal values, collective cultural experience, "our" heritage, or as some other
         				abstraction removed from concrete experience. Physically and ideologically, art
         is
         				isolated from the rest of life, surrounded with solemnity, protected from moral
         				judgement. Our very encounters with it in museums, galleries and art books are
         				structured to create the illusion that the significance of art has little or nothing
         				to do with the conflicts and problems that touch common experience. Established
         art
         				ideologies reinforce this illusion. According to both popular and scholarly
         				literature, true artistic imaginations transcend the ordinary fantasies, the class
         				and sex prejudices and the bad faith that beset other human minds. Indeed, most
         of
         				us believe that art, by definition, is always good—because it is of purely esthetic
         				significance (and the purely esthetic is thought to be good), or because it confirms
         				the existence of the imagination and of individualism, or because it reveals other
         				"timeless" values or truths. Most of us have been schooled to believe that art,
         qua
         				art, if it is "good" art, is never bad for anyone, never has anything to do with
         the
         				oppression of the powerless, and never imposes on us values that are not universally
         				beneficial.</p>
      <p>The modern masterpieces of erotic art that have been discussing enjoy this
         				ideological protection even while they affirm the ideals of male domination and
         				female subjugation. Once admitted to that high category of Art, they acquire an
         				invisible authority that silently acts upon the consciousness, confirming from
         on
         				high what social customs and law enforce from below. In their invisible and hence
         				unquestioned authority, they proclaim—without acknowledging it—what men and women
         				can be to themselves and to each other. But once that authority is made visible,
         we
         				can see what is before us: art and artists are made on earth, in history, in
         				organized society. And in the modern era as in the past, what has been sanctified
         as
         				high art and called True, Good and Beautiful is born of the aspirations of those
         who
         				are empowered to shape culture. </p>
