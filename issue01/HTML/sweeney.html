      <h3 align="left">Wages For Housework: The Strategy for Women's Liberation </h3>
      <h5><span style="font-style:italic">Pat Sweeney</span></h5>
      <p>Many "feminist" writers have contributed to the ideology of housework.
         				Radical-feminists, while recognizing the identification of housework with our
         female
         				nature, have proposed sharing this work with a man and leaving the home for outside
         				work. <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Socialist_feminism">Socialist-feminists</a>, describing housework as precapitalist, have pro claimed
         				that our goal should be toward "industrialization," which would liberate our time
         				for more work—but in a factory, if not a collective kitchen. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1987244">Liberal feminists</a> have
         				defined our problem as "lack of consciousness," describing women as dupes of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109849">Madison
            				Avenue</a> ad-men. Finally, there are those feminists who, much to capitalists'
         				rejoicing, have glorified our forced labor in the home as the embodiment of the
         best
         				human potentials: our capacity to nurture and care, our very capacity to love.
         One
         				thing they all agree on is that women should not be paid for this work, because
         this
         				presumably would institutionalize us in the home, and extend the control of the
         				state to "the one area of freedom we have in our lives."</p>
      <p>Contrary to these criticisms, the <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/268913776/">Wages for Housework Committee</a>'s perspective is
         				based on the fact that housework is already controlled and institutionalized
         				(Mother's Day is nothing less than the celebration of this institutionalization!)
         				precisely because this work is unwaged. Society is organized to force us into
         this
         				job, and the fact that we don’t receive a wage for the work continuously undermines
         				our power to refuse it.</p>
      <p>That housework is unwaged means first of all that it appears not as work, but as part
         				of our female nature. Thus, when we refuse part of this work—as, for example,
         				lesbian women do in refusing to provide sexual services to men—we are branded
         as
         				perverts, as if we were breaking some law of nature. We are divided into "good“
         and
         				"bad" women depending on whether or not we do the housework and whether or not
         we do
         				it for free. In this society to be a good woman — or just to be a woman—is to
         be a
         				good servant at everyone's disposal 24 hours a day; it means accepting that this
         				work should not be paid because it supposedly fulfills our nature, and thus contains
         				its own reward.</p>
      <p>Housework is not just washing dishes, scrubbing floors, or raising babies. What we
         do
         				at home is produce and reproduce workers: every day we create and restore the
         				capacity of others (and ourselves) to work, and to be exploited. It is ironic
         that
         				as houseworkers we are not included in the nation’s labor force, for without this
         				work the workforce would not exist. The lack of a wage obscures the indispensability
         				of our work to the functioning of this society. Housework makes every other work
         				possible. No car could be produced, no coal could be dug, no office could be run,
         if
         				there were not women at home servicing and reproducing those who make the cars,
         				those who dig the coal, those who run the offices. This is the sexual division
         of
         				labor: workers make cars, and women make the workers who make the cars. And to
         make
         				a worker is a much more time- and energy-consuming job than to make a car! Not
         only
         				do we "reproduce“ them physically— cooking their dinners, doing the shopping
         				(shopping is work, not consumption as some "feminists" would have us believe).
         We
         				also service workers emotionally—taking the brunt of their tiredness and frustration
         				day after day. And we service workers sexually—the Saturday night screw keeps
         them
         				going for yet another week at the assembly line or desk.</p>
      <p>It appears that we freely donate all this work to our husbands and children out of
         				our love for them. In reality we are working for the same bosses, who are getting
         				two workers for the price of one. Our lives are governed by the same work schedule
         				as those we serve. When we cook dinner or when we "make love" is determined by
         the
         				factory time-clock. Not only the quantity, but also the quality of workers we
         				reproduce is controlled. If they don’t need many workers, we are sterilized; if
         they
         				need more workers we are denied access to contraceptives and are forced to resort
         to
         				backstreet butchers (the right to life is never claimed for women). Likewise,
         if we
         				are on welfare or we tend to produce "troublemakers," we are again sterilized.</p>
      <p>In every case, our sexuality is continuously under control to make sure that we use
         				it productively. Lesbianism and teenage sex are illegal, and rape in the family
         (or
         				the battered wife) is not a crime since readily available money of our
         				own that creates the battered wife or the closet lesbian and forces so many of
         us to
         				remain in unwanted family situations. With money in our hands, we would have the
         				power to walk out whenever we wanted. Men would certainly think twice before raising
         				their hands to us if they knew that we could leave any minute, without the prospect
         				of starving.</p>
      <p>Our wageless condition in the home is the material basis of our dependence on men.
         				This weakness in the community, as wageless houseworkers, is ultimately the weakness
         				of the entire class. Capitalism takes away from us in the community (through
         				inflation—price hikes rent increases, fare increases, etc.) what we have gained
         				through our power in the factory. Women pay a double price for this defeat. Higher
         				prices mean an intensification of our work, since we are expected to absorb the
         cost
         				of inflation with extra work.</p>
      <p>The struggle for wages for housework is a struggle for social power—for women first,
         				but ultimately for the entire working class. In fact, by demanding wages for the
         				work we already do, instead of demanding more work, we are posing the question
         of
         				the immediate reappropriation of the wealth we have produced. Exploitation is
         the
         				enforcement of unpaid labor the only source of capitalist profits. Thus to attack
         				our wagelessness is to attack capitalism at its roots for capital is precisely
         the
         				accumulated labor that has been robbed from workers generation after generation.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the strategy that has been offered to us by "feminists" and <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q164597">the left</a>—the
         				strategy to obtain more work-would only mean further enslavement to the present
         				system. It is capital that poses work as the only natural destiny in our lives,
         not
         				the working class, whose struggles are always directed toward gaining more money
         and
         				less work. To pose the "right to work" as our road to liberation ignores that
         we are
         				already working, and that housework does not wither away when we go out for a
         paid
         				job. Our work at home simply intensifies: we do it at night when everybody is
         				already asleep, or in the morning before everyone awakes or on weekends. Our wages
         				remain low—and they quickly disappear in paying for day-care centers lunches,
         				carfare, etc. Furthermore, with two jobs we have even less time to organize with
         				other women. Unions have long accused women of being backward. But when did unions
         				consider that we are not free to attend meetings after our second job is over
         				because we must hurry to report back to our first one—picking up the kids at the
         				day-care center or babysitter's getting to the supermarket before it closes, fixing
         				dinner for the men who expect it to be ready when they come home from work?</p>
      <p>Another illusion is that to go "out to work" is to break our isolation and gain the
         				possibility of a social life. Very often the isolation of a typing pool or a
         				secretarial office matches our isolation in the home. We certainly aspire to a
         				social life better than the one provided by an assembly line. But going out of
         the
         				home is not much of a relief if we don’t have any money in our hands, or if we
         go
         				out just for more work.</p>
      <p>We also reject the idea that sharing our exploitation in the home with a man can be
         a
         				strategy for liberation. "Sharing the housework" is not an invention of <span style="font-style:italic">the Women's Movement</span>. Women have continuously tried to get men to share this work. Despite some
         				victories, we have discovered that this battle also has many limitations. First,
         the
         				man is not home most of the time. If he brings in the money, and we are economically
         				dependent on him, we don’t have the power to force him to do housework. In fact
         it
         				is often more work for us to get the man to share the work than do it ourselves.
         				Most importantly, this strategy confines us to an individual struggle which does
         not
         				give us the power (or the protection) of a mass struggle. And it assumes that
         every
         				woman has (or wants) a man with whom to share the work.</p>
      <p>As for a possible rationalization of house work, we must immediately say that we are
         				not interested in making our work more efficient or more productive for capital.
         We
         				are interested in reducing our work, and ultimately refusing it altogether. But
         as
         				long as we work in the home for nothing, no one really cares how long or how hard
         we
         				work. For capital only introduces advanced technology to cut its costs of production
         				after wage gains by the working class. Only if we make our work cost (i.e. only
         if
         				we make it uneconomical) will capital "discover“ the technology to reduce it.
         At
         				present, we often have to go out for a second shift of work to afford the dishwasher
         				that should cut down our housework!</p>
      <p>Who will pay for this work?</p>
      <p>We demand wages for housework from the government for two major reasons. First, every
         				sector of the economy benefits from our work we don’t work for one boss, we work
         for
         				all the bosses. Consequently we demand the money from the state. Second, the
         				government already is our boss. In every country the government is responsible
         for
         				guaranteeing an adequate labor force to industry. This means that the government
         				directly regulates and controls our work through the family, world population
         				control, immigration laws, and finally by entering the community whenever we refuse
         				to perform our work.</p>
      <p>The question "who will pay?" is usually posed so as to subvert the cause. It is
         				assumed that the government is broke, and that our demand will only divide the
         				working class by forcing the government to tax other workers to pay us a wage.
         In
         				reality, by getting more power for our selves, we will be giving more power not
         only
         				to men (power not over us but with respect to their bosses) but to every sector
         (the
         				young, the elderly, and the wageless in general). We will  begin to
         				break the power relations which so far have kept us divided. Through a united
         				working class we can force the government to tax the corporations, not other
         				workers.</p>
      <p>A posture of defeat also ignores the struggles women have made against housework and
         				what we have been able to win in rélation to this work. It is no accident that
         after
         				the massive struggles welfare mothers waged in the 1960s for more money from the
         				government—the first money we have won for housework—the number of female-headed
         				families has dramatically increased (doubling every decade) along with the number
         of
         				divorces, particularly among women with children, and the number of young women
         who
         				have been able to set up independent households. This is not to glorify welfare.
         				Welfare does not even begin to pay for all our work—we need much more and we need
         it
         				for all of us. But it is to recognize how even a little money has begun to break
         				down some of the most powerful mechanisms of discipline which traditionally have
         				kept us in line.</p>
