      <h5><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q19517707">Susan Yankowitz</a></span></h5>AN APPLE
      <p>Manuelo Manchik admires the apple before devouring it. He cups the thing in the
         					palm of his hand, turning it this way and that; the light bounces off the curves
         					of its golden skin. O golden delicious, you make a mouth water! The fruit is
         					round and firm and fully packed; unlike the mealy banana, it will resist his
         					teeth just a little. Again his mouth waters as he delays the coming pleasure.
         He
         					cups the thing in the palm of one hand, stroking it with the other; it is smooth
         					and cool beneath his fingers. O golden delicious, you do tempt a man! Yes there
         					is no doubt, you were made to be eaten. He opens his mouth wide and chomps
         					through to the core in a single bite. Two black seeds slither in a rill of juice
         					down his chin.</p>BREASTS
      <p>At a gathering of talents, artistic and profane, MM had spotted across the
         					crowded room his own dreamed-of Olympia, half-reclining on a fat settee. The
         					exquisite naturalness of her Manet pose enchanted him no less than her near
         					nudity. Under her see-through blouse her breasts were classic. O wonder. O no
         					wonder that they pushed out the silk (or was it cheap nylon?) of her blouse
         					exactly like breasts; that to exploring hands (at other hours of course for now
         					she was half-reclining naturally alone) they were as round and firm and full
         as
         					round firm full breasts; and that the nipples which tipped these breasts
         					resembled nothing so much as the nipples which tip such breasts. In short and
         in
         					sum, her breasts were truly like breasts. But MM had no interest in the obvious.
         					He was a man of imagination, of poetry even. The excesses of similitude
         					multiplied by their exact number his pleasures. He saw what he saw: Olympia with
         					breasts which were breasts and at the same time various other roundnesses not
         					breasts. And roundness was all, preferable even to that commonplace of
         					literature, ripeness. Only one fact was crucial and he had ascertained it,
         					subtly brushing his fingers against her shoulders: she was not made of wax. So
         					when MM opened his mouth wide one night days later and bit with gusto into the
         					breast on the left, that same breast bled. Damn, he had erred in his
         					distinctions! But Manuelo Manchik was not a man to hang fire. With a gesture
         of
         					magnificent unconcern, he wiped his chin and continued eating.</p>CHYME
      <p>Olympia had accepted that name, accepted too the play of tongue and teeth,
         					accepted even the discomfort of her body crushed beneath him when poing! she
         was
         					punctured. Too late to cry foul! she fell, undone by mastication. Softened by
         					saliva she travelled in mouthfuls through his gullet and into the fat sac of
         his
         					stomach. There she lodges, divided against herself. Fool, she chides herself,
         to
         					have come to chyme!</p>
      <p>Her head is separated from her body. Her legs, each in one long piece, are
         					severed from her crotch and from each other, Her two loose breasts bounce from
         					wall to wall, free-floating, as his stomach contracts and dilates in diges-
         					tion. Pressed against the locked pyloric door sheisgrateful at least that she
         					will not be further fractured by the cleaving peristaltic actions of his
         					intestine. There is no disguising the situation: she is split, sundered, she
         is
         					not in one piece. If she does not want to sour in his belly (and why would she
         					desire such a fate?) she must somehow (but how?) reverse the process herself.
         					But herself is not. From deep inside Manuelo's stomach, she surveys the chaos
         of
         					her members and thinks: I must pull myself together! </p>DREAM?
      <p>Maybe it's all a dream, she reasons reasonably enough, and when I wake up I'll
         					find myself me again, just me, no one's Olympia, in toto. And so she falls to
         					sleep so she can fall awake. This is the dream she finds: she is standing in
         					water being fucked in the ass by the shameless beak of a crane. His long legs
         					pinion her hips. He wades and fishes, taking his time. It hurts. What can she
         do
         					but submit? Her name is not Leda; the power is all his.</p>ESCAPE
      <p>She wakes up gagging with her left foot in her mouth. No use sucking on the toes,
         					they're not sour balls, they won't dissolve or sweeten her palate. Her mouth
         is
         					dry with sleep and anxiety; she could have suffocated during that nighttime
         					shift. There is no escaping the fact now: she must escape! But how? She wags
         her
         					head a few times to float the foot free as she ponders the ins and outs. The
         					nearest exit is the rear. Can she deliver herself through there? MM is  notoriously tight-assed. She experiments, jamming her foot in the
         					door; MM jumps. Assured of the flexibility of that aperture, she glances upward
         					to the other hole, further away but far less foul. Keeping her foot wedged in
         					the crack she sticks a finger up his throat; MM gags. Both routes are open to
         					her. Which out should she take?</p>FLATULENCE
      <p>MM ejects a fart and holds his nose in indignation. The cream of the art world
         					thins around him. Many noses are held. How could she, the bitch, upset him so?
         					He excuses himself gracefully from the room, leaving his smell behind. Is he
         					stuck with her forever? Must he pay with his immaculate reputation for one
         					night's overindulgence? O she is lodged there in his gut, forcing him to take
         					strong measures.</p>GLUTTONY
      <p>"I'd like to eat you up," he had said. She had been enthusiastic. Whose sin was
         					it then? Definitely food for thought, his and hers.</p>HIS AND HERS
      <p>HIS: She tempted me. <br /> HERS: He ate.</p>INDIGESTION
      <p>"I'm carrying her around. She weighs me down. Really, I'm not a free man
         					anymore," Manuelo confided to his friend the doctor, picking his teeth with an
         					indigestible sliver of fingernail. "You must get her out of your system,"
         					replied the learned doc. "May I prescribe a laxative?" </p>JUSTICE MORE OR LESS POETIC
      <p>She hadn't cared who drove into her. He had had a full set. It was good sport
         					yes. And what a ball! He had swung hard, lifted high and, rimming the cup first
         					with a brilliant display of control, had dropped right in: hole in one, Mandelo
         					Manchik was not the sort to putter around. Well, neither was she.</p>
      <p>"You're a real swinger," he complimented her.</p>
      <p>"Just par for the course, she replied, refering of course to her life.</p>
      <p>Now she was teed-off, finding herself in the trap. O she had been green in those
         					green days, but she would lie in the roughage no longer. With a method to her
         					madness she slices into his intestine with her teeth. MM howls then doubles
         					over, squeezing her (according to plan) more closely together; his cramp adheres
         					her. When he straightens up she delights to see the connections: her legs
         					secured to her groin and her groin to her torso, o classic venus though still
         					not Olympia for her breasts and arms are still somewhere adrift. And her head,
         					that obstinate be-bumped ball, is lying slightly offcourse, planning the next
         					shot. </p>KIDDING
      <p>When she reached twenty-five, her psychiatrist had said (though gently): "All
         					kidding aside, my dear, you are no longer a child prodigy." She had run home
         					crying to her mother, blurting the tragic news. "So? What are you going to do
         					with yourself?" mother had asked, heart-to-heart.</p>
      <p>"I gotta grow up sometime, ma. He's right. So here's what: I'm gonna have a
         					baby!" "What? What?" disbelieving ma had hollered, flinging her daughter from
         					her sacked-out breast. "I'm going to have a bastard?" "No, ma, no," she calmed
         					her mother. "I'm gonna have the bastard."</p>
      <p>The child was born crying and one gulp of air later, died. The bereaved not yet a
         					mother invited her psychiatrist to the funeral and told him then and there that
         					they were quits. That was how he would remember her: standing gravely at the
         					grave, dressed all in black, a grown-up color.</p>LIKE
      <p>"I like you," MM had said (as had others), thinking to flatter.</p>
      <p>"No you're not," she retorted almost at once, angry almost. "You're not like me
         					at all."</p>MILK OF MAGNESIA
      <p>He takes the prescribed dosage and waits.</p>NO ANSWERS
      <p>In the park, Abigale is lying on her belly, waiting as pre-arranged for her best
         					friend, the putative Olympia. She pokes with a spring twig at the underside of
         a
         					caterpillar, trying to hurry it out of its skin.</p>
      <p>"Where are your wings, caterpillar?" she asks.</p>
      <p>"And where was I before I was born?"</p>
      <p>"And where, sky, do you get off, looking down on me?"</p>
      <p>Everything is mute. The silence is its own question.</p>OSCILLATIONS
      <p>Suddenly everything starts churning. Using all anchored organs for ballast, she
         					holds herself together; he will not shake her up, will not fragment her. His
         					belly bloats with gases, goes into a rumble. So! He is trying to purge himself
         					by purging her. The rejection infuriates her. She will come out when she is good
         					and ready, and she will use the exit of her choice. Tough shit, Manuelo! She
         					braces hersef against his spasms.</p>P'S &amp; Q'S
      <p>"Mind them!" her mother had warned. But what were they? She had learned the
         					alphabet thoroughly but the deeper meanings of p's and q's had eluded her. If
         					she had gone further in her study of letters, would she have led a simpler
         					life?</p>REFLECTION
      <p>MM strains.</p>
      <p>O resists.</p>
      <p>The battle is in earnest. Some old words rise to the occasion. "The man who hates
         					you and the woman who is hated are probably one and the same," her psychiatrist
         					had suggested, maddening her (at the time) into silence.</p>
      <p>Was he speaking of suicide?</p>
      <p>Hers?</p>
      <p>The thought sobers her and sheds light. After all, it is almost spring out there.
         					The crocuses are already beginning their day-open night-close ritual. She could
         					if she chose walk outside without a coat, breathing sunlight. Someone, also
         					without a coat, might be coming round the corner fated to bump chests with her.
         					Her mind too, she realizes, can turn corners. And certainly Abigale, her old
         					friend, must be waiting for her in the park this very moment.</p>SURE IS
      <p>His stomach is storming around her with a vengeance. She holds on for dear life.
         					O yes, it is so so dear, good old life. It is indeed of the essence, hers in
         					particular. Her imagination has never yet failed her. She will live! Out of the
         					darkness the closet, the belly of this male whale. The way is lighted by divine
         					coincidence as MM opens his mouth widely to expel a belch. The light rays down
         					his throat, a sign. Her route has been decided. Really, there are possibilities
         					in everything, even a belch, she concludes.</p>TRANSLATION (AFTER RILKE)
      <p>Manuelo has thrown caution to the winds. "Do something," he pleads. "I need
         					help."</p>
      <p>"Yes," agrees the doctor, "you must change your life."</p>
      <p>O but it hurts! His eyes are blind with tears.</p>
      <p>Manuelo weeps with the effort to restrain them.</p>UNITED SHE CAN
      <p>He falls back into his chair, trying to relax, inadvertently giving her the room
         					she needs to maneuver. She holds herself snugly in her own arms; they mate with
         					their respective sockets, home at last. Now able to manipulate with her hands,
         					the rest is easy. She catches her drifting breasts and fixes them onto her
         					chest. She knows which is which, having observed in moments of self-criticism
         					that the left is slightly larger than the right. It occurs to her at this
         					juncture that nature is purposive in all plans. Nothing is very much like
         					anything else, each thing is essentially itself and under no compulsion to be
         					other. Goodbye then, Manuelo's Olympia! Goodbye velvet settee and languid pose!
         					MM's ass presses down into the seat, squeezing her upward. Her body rises toward
         					her head and miraculously naturally unites with it. He cannot keep her down.
         He
         					does not want to. She is on her way.</p>VOYAGING
      <p>Still afraid that she will fall apart — these connections are so tenuous, so
         					untested — she kicks her feet, gingerly at first, then with increasing vigor
         as
         					she finds to her elation that they will move her. She paddles upward toward his
         					heart. O the current there is strong; she struggles bravely; she falters, sucked
         					into its vortex; she kicks, she flails and manages, through stratagems newly
         					known to science, to bypass the whole throbbing mass. The worst is over. She
         					catches her breath at his lungs and then, with a great final spurt, dives
         					through his esophagus.</p>WHOOPS!
      <p>She spills out of his mouth.</p>
      <p>"Hi, Manuelo."</p>
      <p>"Olympia!"</p>
      <p>They stand gaping at each other, both of them messy with blood and other slime.
         					She sets him straight at once. "My real name's Claire. Can I take a shower?"</p>x =
      <p>Claire, not Olympia then. He looks at her in this new light as he scrubs her
         					back. How could he not have noticed those pimples on her shoulders? Perhaps that
         					is why he was unable to stomach her. But no, no, the mystery is more than skin
         					deep.</p>
      <p>"Scrub harder, Manuelo."</p>
      <p>He does, marveling at the dead skin which peels off, flake by flake. How many
         					layers are there? He stares into the skin, lost in ponderings beneath the
         					surface and then, with a wild cry of exultation, realizes that he has found his
         					calling. Dermatology will teach him the topography of the flesh. Through that
         					mundane profession he will explore the twin mysteries of desire and disgust.</p>
      <p>"You're breaking the skin again!" shouts Claire.</p>
      <p>"Enough!"</p>YOU
      <p>"You have helped me to find myself," they admit simultaneously and, with a tender
         					embrace, part forever.</p>ZOON
      <p>Shining in the sunlight which is shining too, she runs to the park. Abigale is
         					asleep; a caterpillar is making a moustache on her upper lip. Claire picks it
         					off and tosses it carelessly into the grass. It slithers away as Abigale
         					wakes.</p>
      <p>"Where have you been?" drowsy A asks. Claire hesitates. What words could convey
         					the absurdity, the enormity of her adventure? An attempt is necessary. She
         					begins to stammer a reply but her stomach, miraculously to the rescue, speaks
         					first: loudly it rumbles, fiercely it growls. Both women laugh. The noise
         					suffices for response.</p>
      <p>Claire stretches out her hands to Abigale and, with a little tug, pulles her to
         					her feet.</p>
      <p>"It's time for another beginning," Claire says.</p>
      <p>"It always was," Abigale grins.</p>
      <p>And off they go, old friends hand in hand, in search of apples.</p>
