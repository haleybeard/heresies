      <h5><span style="font-style:italic">Joan Braderman</span></h5>
      <p>In this essay, I would like to suggest where feminism can lead us and what myths must
         finally be left behind to get there. The nature of these myths—the myths of equality,
         individualism and democratic liberalism—which underwrite our humanist heritage, account
         for the weakest elements of feminist ideology. The recognition that feminism is an
         ideology, like <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9061">Marx</a>'s recognition that humanism is an ideology (i.e., not a
         discourse whose "truth" was inseparable from the world it described) is a necessary
         step
         in re-examining what feminism is and what it can do. </p>
      <p> I will use as a conceit the form of "the contradiction"—that underlying, dynamic
         mechanism of history—in a way that is sometimes more metaphorical than concrete. I
         take
         the liberty of using this model rhetorically at times to begin to establish a series
         of
         interrelationships between ideologies and their culture. I use it to suggest the many
         ways the several spheres of interest to Heresies readers—art, feminism and their
         political context—are subject to a set of analogous and mutually reinforcing ideological
         myths. Most feminists and artists alike are still held captive by the power of these
         seductive belief systems, although they threaten the coherence of our arguments,
         threaten our interests and threaten the very survival of the ideal of freedom.</p>
      <p> A confrontation between the facts and fictions which surround us becomes inevitable
         within an escalating spiral of contradictions. The first group to experience directly
         the essen- tial contradictions of the society we live in is, of course, the lowest
         class: the unemployed, the poorest, least skilled, most exploited working people.
         Next,
         the marginal groups, in North America: people of color, immigrants, the elderly, etc.
         Artists are marginal too. They feel the economic squeeze in recessions, may even become
         politicized as a result. And across all these groups are women. As groups, then, women
         and artists have a low priority in the hierarchy of capital.</p>
      <p> To give up the humanist myths, those most cherished ideals of our own class, the
         bourgeoisie, which were forged when it was the revolutionary class, is difficult indeed.
         But give them up we must, for in the face of heightening contradictions–economic,
         biological, ideological—we have no choice. </p>
      <p>By 1976, the women's movement seems to have nearly as many political lines as there
         are
         women in it. This partly healthy, partly disturbing fact reflects with painful clarity
         both the strengths and implicit weaknesses of the feminist critique of society. What
         is
         feminist practice? What is it to be a feminist in 1976? Is it to be an individual
         woman
         "making it" in a man's world? Is it to recognize woman's historical oppression and,
         released from individual frustration and guilt, to take on collective responsibility?
         What is the nature of such a responsibility? Is it restricted to oneself? To oneself
         and
         the women one sees every week? Is this a responsibility to oneself, to women, to men,
         to
         history? In short, is feminism, as an ideology, fundamentally dangerous to the sexism
         it
         despises? If so, how?</p>
      <p> To many women, enmeshed in the growing contradictions of late capitalist society,
         feminism, by 1976, has proven as much a trap as a liberation. What seemed to so many
         of
         us as little as five years ago a potentially revolutionary force now appears to be
         virtually co-opted. The great capitalist commodity machine has produced a whole new
         catalogue of cultural commodities: the feminist writer, artist, poet; the teminist
         academic, professional, journalist, TV persona; the feminist token with that "feminist
         mystique." She is for sale in the cultural marketplace. She is tough, durable,
         tireless. She is "sexually liberated" (a great lay). She works harder than a man.
         She
         has to. She is still a woman in a world that calls people "mankind." That is, "equality"
         for women still equals inequality for women. This is a contradiction.</p>
      <p> What kind of contradiction? It is a contradiction between the ideology of bourgeois
         feminism and economic and biological fact. The economic facts of life for the great
         majority of women remain the same: unpaid domestic labor, ill-paid labor in the work
         force. Biological fact (which is gender difference along with its cultural baggage)
         proposes a contradiction, even for those of us who are female tokens of one sort or
         another, who are members of the bourgeoisie.</p>
      <p> Our psychosexual behavior, like our economic roles, is wholly determined by an
         inherited system of power relations, not only in the public sector, but at deeper
         levels, in the formation—within the family—of the psyche itself. Hence, as <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q453560">Juliet
            	Mitchell</a> so carefully  describes,  it is the concept of equality which is
         invalid within our system. The abstract ideal of equality, she demonstrates, provides
         the philosophical basis for our laws. Our legal system, at its best, functions as
         if
         each of its individual constituents were equal. If some people have only their labor
         to
         sell, and this labor produces more value than it returns to the laborer an unequal
         exchange has taken place. The laborer, then, and the owner of the means to produce
         that
         "surplus value" are not equal. If some people are denied, by virtue of their color,
         access even to the skills of labor, to whom are they equal? If half of all people
         have
         babies and half do not, are they all "equal"? Logical incompatabilities arise: what
         is
         different is not the same, and gender (among other things) means difference.</p>
      <p> Radical feminism has tried to take on this contradiction indeed proclaimed it the
         essential contradiction in our form of social organization. Between biology and destiny,
         it proposes, stands consciousness. Woman's oppression vertically crosses class lines,
         crosses race lines; women, armed with "consciousness" would speak to each other across
         a
         history of divisions and change the world. Women's groups would not only clarify the
         areas of shared experience which foster that consciousness, but would serve as support
         communities. With sisterhood for strength, women would hit male supremacy where it
         lived: at home. Yet what, after all, has changed? The quality of life for a few
         privileged women—a small step. Was all that fervor, sisterhood and revolutionary
         idealism that was meant to reinvent the terms for a mass movement so easily engorged,
         packaged and recycled?</p>
      <p> For radical feminism too has been partially co-opted. Since it had already dropped
         out
         of the broader (sexist) political arena, it provided support systems for women, but
         toward an uncertain end. Seeing few alternatives and tantalized by a taste of power
         women often used that strength to re-enter the dominant culture to become as
         competitive, as "good" as men. Has the women's movement had so little concrete impact
         on
         most women's lives?</p>
      <p> Certainly the patriarchy was sufficiently threatened to let the feminist token into
         the
         limelight. (Why co-opt without advertising the co-opted product?) But she did not
         make
         it into the statistics. The economic facts so far as most women are concerned remain
         unchanged: unpaid domestic labor; ill-paid labor in the work force. The wage
         differential between men and women in fact is now greater than it was ten years ago.
         Even the hard-won victory of abortion (for a price), even the possibility of "equal
         rights" before the very laws which uphold a system of inequality, are a slap in the
         face
         to an ideology which aimed to alter the very "nature“ of human relationships. This
         too
         is a contradiction. </p>
      <p>What kind of contradiction? It is a contradiction between an ideology and a system;
         an
         ideology which has placed its profoundly humanist hope in individual consciousness
         as
         somehow separable from the structures in which that consciousness is created.
         Demystifying the contradictory elements of traditional feminism itself, then, is part
         of
         our task. In capitalist society, the process through which human labor is translated
         into commodity, then capital, is a process necessarily affecting not only the production
         of tractors and bombs but the production of ideology. This process puts
         intellectual labor like esthetic labor, like factory labor like reproductive labor
         in
         the service of a system which generates a surplus of wealth for the few and subsistence
         for the many. This contradiction—between the forces of production (labor) and the
         property relations of production (ownership) is the contradiction which <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marxism"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12716775">Marxists</a></a> claim moves history, because it produces class struggle: the
         power of masses of people to labor becomes the power to revolt.</p>
      <p> This contradiction has moved history. But, feminists ask, has it altered the basic
         relation between woman and man, woman and childrearing, woman and psychosexual slavery?
         For the hypocrisy of bourgeois ideology in relation to bourgeois practice is
         paradigmatic within the structure of the family. Marriage, ostensibly a contractual
         agreement between consenting equals, is in fact a property relation between an owner
         and
         an exploited, isolated and powerless worker.</p>
      <p> It is the belief in the illusion that such social contracts can be fulfilled that
         has
         hung feminists on the horns of contradiction. Feminism was born in the 17th century
         along with the concept of equality of individuals. It was as <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q432851">Sheila
            Rowbotham</a> has documented,  heated in the cauldron of bourgeois revolution and simmered in the
         idealism of 19th-century Utopianism à <a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/ulan/500069988">la Fourier</a> who
         claimed that "the change in historical epoch can always be determined by the progress
         of
         women toward freedom." </p>
      <p>Bourgeois feminism has begun, then, in its history of leaps and starts to identify
         and
         attack its sexist enemy, and taken a few long strides away from female feudalism for
         the
         benefit of some bourgeois women. But the heart of the problem remains. Feminists from
         <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7700030">Tennessee Claflin</a> to <span style="font-style:italic">Isadora Duncan</span> have scored high in locating
         it. "At the ballot box is not where the shoe pinches. It is at home where the husband
         is
         the supreme ruler that the little difficulty arises; he will not surrender this absolute
         power unless he is compelled," wrote Claflin in 1871.  Duncan, in her
         1927 autobiography said, "Any intelligent woman who reads the marriage contract and
         then
         goes into it, deserves all the consequences."  Here is the confounding point. Monogamy asserts a situation in which one
         	individual "owns" another. It is not ownership  per se that is in question
         now, but again, the mystification of what the individual is and can control. In
         participating in the compromised "equality" of marriage, each individual agrees to
         propagate the species in the context of the values of patriarchy. Values are learned,
         sexuality is formed, ideology is maintained—within the family.</p>
      <p> When feminists claim that "the personal is politicalpersonal is political" they refer in a sense, to this problem. Their
         hypothesis is that one can generalize from the individual, internal dynamics of sexist
         oppression, to a general rule. <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9215">Freud</a>'s revelation
         of the structures of the unconscious confirms to an extent the validity of that
         enterprise. But up to now feminists have not taken it far enough. Having accepted
         the
         existence of subconscious structural analogues which mirror the differences between
         the
         sexes in the world, we can now proceed with the knowledge that, as a group, we are
         bound
         not only by the manifest political forms of our oppression but by these internal psychic
         monsters. In attempting to combat these monsters, however, feminists have often mistaken
         the cart for the horse. The personal is political—but with few exceptions, this
         invocation has simply generated a longer list of symptoms of the sexist disease. We
         must
         locate the causes of this disease if we are ever to cure it. We must exploit Freud's
         science of the mind, but only insofar as it is conjoined with the science of history;
         that is to say out of the context of individualism.</p>
      <p> Sisterhood is really powerful only insofar as it is armed with a coherent theory
         and a
         mass strategy. We are in and of our culture; so is the feminist ideal. We must pursue,
         with maximum scientific rigor, the vanguard theories of culture which culture has
         produced. We must use the best available tools to locate the incoherence— the
         contradictions—in extant phallocentric models and generate predictive models based
         in
         the experience of both halves of the human race. Feminists who wish to throw Freud
         out
         the window because of simplistic readings of "penis envy" current in popular psychology
         might well take a look at Mitchell's <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/4238151051781333530003/">Feminism and
            Psychoanalysis</a> for a re-examination of the usefulness of psychoanalysis to
         feminist analysis. Her effort there is exemplary. We cannot just look back
         nostalgically to ancient matriarchies. Indeed, fantasies about matriarchy in our era
         are
         pure science fiction. But their existence does suggest that alternate models for culture
         can exist.</p>
      <p> Recent controversy over Mitchell's book, among feminists and male psychoanalytic
         theorists here and abroad, suggests the "hotness" of this issue. Interestingly, this
         relation of sexuality to political economy is also being strongly developed outside
         a
         feminist context, most prominently on a major intellectual front—in the tradition
         of
         French structuralism. European feminists, especially in England and France, have thus
         been drawn to that tradition as heightened contradictions impel them to seek out means
         for their resolution. The main tendency in this area is necessarily phallocentric:
         it is
         still being written largely through the cipher of a male experience of the world.
         But if
         we as women don’t begin to write ourselves into history, who will? For so far, compared
         to the scope of the theoretical, strategic and practical task ahead, the "woman
         question" has really only been given lip service by the most advanced intellectual
         sciences —not surprising since they are "man-made."</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34787">Engels</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9061">Marx</a> and others have, of course, identified the monogamous,
         patriarchal family as the central prison for woman. Mechanistic Marxists therefore
         claim
         that releasing her from this singular prison into the work force (under socialism)
         must
         guarantee her freedom. Does it? Has it?</p>
      <p> Not significantly; not yet. The major 20th-century socialist revolutions have made
         some
         progress, removing, as in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q148">China</a>, the most barbaric manifestations of sexist domination.
         Immediately following the Soviet revolution, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1394">Lenin</a>'s program
         included not only the training of women to join the work force at all levels, but
         the
         legalization of abortion, free, accessible divorce, communal daycare, etc. Within
         ten
         years, however <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q855">Stalin</a>ist backlash hit these family issues hardest; much harder,
         predictably, than the building of an extra-domestic women's work force. In China,
         with
         the Cultural Revolution and before, ideological struggle against the values of
         patriarchy has at least begun. But in the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15180">U.S.S.R.</a>, in the context of
         their drive to quickly meet economic priorites which created the bastard known as
         "state
         capitalism," it was easier to fall back on the ingrained behaviors of the traditional
         family unit for free work by women in the home.</p>
      <p> The <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q308714">American Communist Party</a> reflects this tendency, still defending the
         "fighting family unit" as a revolutionary force—in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q30">America</a>, a reactionary notion. In
         fact. mothers have been strong revolutionaries. The strength of the women of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q881">Vietnam</a> in
         the long battle to defeat American imperialism is a case in point. But, as in <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q262">Algeria</a>,
         where fighting European imperialism also meant the reassertion of the heavily
         patriarchal values of Arab and Islamic culture, women's fate has most often been:
         off
         the battlefield and back to the kitchen. The contradictions of the double standard
         apparently are so heightened during periods of revolution that, as with <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q83372"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q83372">Bolsheviks</a></a> like <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q179558">Alexandra Kollontai</a>, the
         preaching and practice of "free love" (and all it implies) becomes acceptable —for
         a
         brief time. Despite Lenin's great sympathy and work for women, his Victorianism won
         out in the area of sex. Even the Soviet woman engineer
         comes home to work that is still hers, and still never  done.</p>
      <p> In the U.S., too, anti-feminist backlash, somewhat reminiscent of the Stalinist attack
         on women's freedom, splits American feminism down its uncertain center. Though
         reformists suggest that there is room in a liberal America to heal the wounds of women,
         liberalism is particularly dangerous since it cleverly masks its own conservatism,
         its
         own investment in the status quo. Liberal ideology neatly instantiates the two-part
         form
         of the contradiction. "Its progressive side provides a rationale for defending the
         rights of individuals against the state. Its reactionary side emphasized that capitalism
         is not a system where one class exploits another but is rather a collection of
         individuals, any one of whom can succeed if he or she so decides."</p>
      <p> I hope it is becoming clear how ideologically messy liberalism really is from a
         post-humanist perspective in which the individual can no longer be seen as the subject
         of history. Liberalism is seen by leftists as a joke because it bears so tenuously
         the
         wan hopes of a bankrupt humanism and is ultimately, untenable. Even hardcore
         conservatism is more internally coherent. Conservatives and Marxists alike might
         describe capitalism as a system in which the "stronger" individuals make out. The
         difference, of course, is that conservatives say so approvingly, grounding their
         argument in the old dog-eat-dog theory of what they call human nature. Marxists have
         favored the idea that the industrial capitalist system tends to pervert or alienate
         what
         is potentially, or at a given historical moment "good" in human beings. Stated so
         simply, both are inadequate readings but at least they rehearse the consistency of
         these
         positions.</p>
      <p> The liberal wants to enjoy the fruits of his class privilege while salving his guilty
         conscience with a quasi-philosophic posture proposing that every individual (being
         protected by 'equality' before the law, by ’equal' opportunity measures, etc.) could
         theoretically be enjoying this same privilege if he or she were as hard-working and
         dauntless as him/herself. Thus the liberal buys off with a little charity or minimal
         social welfare all those who, by some extreme individual misfortune, can’t quite cut
         it.</p>
      <p>Here we return to the underbelly of co-optation. While a bill assuring equal
         rights before unequal laws is flung in our faces, and even defeated (adding insult
         to
         injury), the dominant media simultaneously declare the women's movement to be "over"
         or
         somehow "won" because of the presence of one and a half news anchor-women on TV or
         the
         financial viability of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3656351">Ms. Magazine</a>. Capitalist propaganda demonstrates before our eyes
         that by inference, if one woman can do work that one man can do, women are the achieved
         "equals" of men. The responsibility for change is thus cleverly switched back onto
         the
         shoulders of individual women; to change the world, all you really must do is
         change yourself. And the mapping of contradictions comes full circle.</p>
      <p> The liberal
         feminist, like the liberal social democrat, learns to sate herself on the token goodies
         she is tendered. Or the radical feminist (who, lacking a viable mass strategy, is
         a
         liberal in disguise) tries to build a separatist island on which she and her sisters
         can
         be "free." It's a dilemma. I was, and in some ways still am, such a radical feminist.
         After all, I am a member of the women's group which publishes this magazine. We try
         to
         experiment with anti-oligarchic forms, collective practice. But what is an egalitarian
         island in a sea of capitalist contradictions but something doomed, as it were, to
         sinking?</p>
      <p> Witness a little linguistic contradiction and the issues it raises for us in Heresies.
         We are constituted as a collective. Adopting one of the stronger aspects of feminist
         practice, we attempt to chip away at the hierarchical authority structures of The
         System on a micro level by
         attempting to produce a theoretical magazine on a collective basis. The assumption
         here
         is that theory and practice must develop together in a dialectical relationship. But
         in
         order to function as a legal entity, we are transformed to Heresies Collective, Inc.;
         an
         incorporated collective. This is either redundant or ironic. The fact is, we don’t
         even
         aspire to making profits but are completely dependent on the legal and business
         structures around us.</p>
      <p>This dependence relation, the impossibility of autonomy within a given economic
         structure, has meant about a two-year life-span for most American collectives before
         us,
         according to popular lore. This dependence also means that artists, particularly those
         artists being forced by heightened economic contradictions to face political realities,
         must re-examine their place in our culture. The feminist filmmaker for example, has
         had
         to confront this issue head on. Film, more than any other artform, requires the mas-
         tery of machine technology. For women, that technology and the authority it connotes
         has
         been historically taboo. There are exceptions in the history of film  but the percentage
         of women filmmakers is dramatically low for a 20th- century art. Feminists with the
         energy and support of their sisters in the movement have begun to break that taboo.
         But
         in doing so, they have been thrown against a major contradiction facing all
         "independent" filmmakers: the problem of capital. For to make films requires large
         amounts of capital, capital which is controlled by the ruling classes, middle-class
         liberals included.</p>
      <p> Advocates of independent filmmaking from <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q450382">Maya Deren</a> in the 1940s
         (implicitly) to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q21176228">Annette
            Michelson</a> in the 1960s (explicitly in her article "<a href="http://www.focorevistadecinema.com.br/FOCO8-9/michelsonradicaldveng.htm">Film and the
            Radical Aspiration</a>")  have proposed that a stance
         	outside of the commercial market is itself a "political" gesture. It is—to the  extent that money can be garnered from liberals to make "art" as long as it
         is not fundamentally dangerous. But can any political art which attempts to attack
         the
         assumptions of The System from within patriarchal capitalism actually threaten it?
         This
         has been and will be an area of debate for many political estheticians and ar- tists
         and
         can hardly be answered here.</p>
      <p> But we can and must confront the question. From what is the "independent" filmmaker
         or
         artist independent? She is not independent from the need to make a living. She is
         not
         independent from the need for capital—money which gives the power to make her films
         and
         distribute her films within a tight commercial media monopoly. When a feminist wonders
         why capitalists won’t hand over the money to make antisexist films, she, like her
         "independent" male counterpart, must face the terms of her depend- ence. She has begun
         to beg, borrow or steal (translated as win grants, go into debt, etc.) the capital
         to
         write herself into visual history, making films about the experience of women; viz:
         the
         films of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1711898"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1711898">Julia Reichert</a></a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q452238"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q452238">Yvonne Rainer</a></a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q449349"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q449349">Barbara
               Kopple</a></a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q239823"><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q239823">Chantal Ackerman</a></a>, and many
         others. But who actually sees these films? They are shown in women's festivals, in
         avant-garde and political forums in a few major cities. She is, in short, caught in
         that
         same economic trap. Cooperatives for pooling resources and sharing distribution efforts,
         such as <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q16253555">New
            Day Films</a>, are beginning to form; they are collectives like Heresies. But
         the absolute dependence on the inconsistent, discrimate charity of liberals is the
         underside of that ultimately romantic hope for "independence." The terms for
         independence, then, among artists and feminists, are the very terms of dependence.
         Yet
         another contradiction.</p>
      <p> I would like to convince all feminists that it is time to realign with the Left.
         Current economic realities, heightening contradictions, and the topography of world
         imperialism reaching its limits, are forcing many groups in America to confront their
         need for unity. The traditionally sectarian American Left itself is beginning to move
         toward coalition and alliance, toward unity across color lines, across race lines,
         across class lines and across gender lines. Within such a potential
         configuration women could speak to other women. We are beginning to recognize that
         all
         oppressed peoples within capitalism must come together if we are even to begin to
         be
         able to defend ourselves against the attacks and backlash of this system, much less
         to
         build a new one.</p>
      <p> Several feminist strategies for such a realignment of women with the broader struggle
         for freedom are presented in this issue of Heresies (see "Toward
         Socialist-Feminism" and "<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7959525">Wages for Housework</a>"). This
         does not mean that women will not have to continue to force the priority of their
         own
         demands in relation to the needs of others. Women will need autonomy to develop theory
         and strategy accountable to our own needs within a broad movement, to avoid the failures
         of socialist experiments in the past. Thus, we must make our fight in the context
         of a
         movement we help to define and build, a movement that can take on the class
         contradiction as well as the racial and sexual contradictions implicit in the structures
         of the larger society. For, on these structures, the fate of all women, like it or
         not,
         is inextricably dependent. To wed feminism to the myths and false hopes of liberal
         idealism is to contribute to the systematic liquidation of its potential power.</p>
