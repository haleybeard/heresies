      <h5><span style="font-style:italic">Accion para la Liberacion de la Mujer Peruana</span></h5>
      <p> We are a group of women who have organized to study, work and fight for our
         				liberation, and especially to work with and for our sisters who suffer a double
         				oppression: in being women and in belonging to a social sector which has been
         				historically dominated and exploited. </p>
      <p>The struggle of women is integrally bound to the struggle of working-class
         					women.</p>
      <p>No! to Mother's Day.</p>
      <p>Yes! to Peruvian Woman's Day.</p>
      <p>Less homage, more rights.</p>
      <p> Why are we named <span style="font-style:italic">Action for the Liberation of Peruvian Women</span>?</p>
      <p>Because we want to carry out our work without euphemisms or timidity—in short,
         				without masks or half-measures. It is correct to call actions which are destined
         to
         				radically change our condition by their rightful name: liberation.</p>
      <p>Ours is simultaneously a study-group and an action-group. We are by no means a
         				political party. We do not aspire to be an institution with traditional hierarchic
         				structure. We reject verticalism, dogmatism and leadership positions. Ideologically,
         				we align ourselves within free Humanist Socialism and adopt the best of its tenets
         				conducive to female emancipation. </p>
      <p>Without national liberation, there can be no women's liberation. Fight!</p>
      <p>Only reactionary men are our enemies!</p>
      <p>Sisters, Unite with us!</p>
      <p>Liberation is action!</p>
      <p> Because we cannot separate our specific problems from our socio-economic context,
         				all our work strategies are adapted to the actual conditions of our country. We
         do
         				not copy foreign movements because we are aware of living in a Third-World Society
         				where imperialism is our most powerful enemy. Therefore we express solidarity
         with
         				other liberation struggles on this continent, as well as with other women and
         men
         				fighting for national liberation in their respective countries. </p>
      <p> To analyze the historic and social origins of our condition is to revolutionize our
         				understanding of the world.</p>
      <p> We believe our liberation is inseparable from that of other oppressed groups—workers
         				and peasants. The liberation of our brothers will never be realized while their
         				women—workers and peasants too—are second-class citizens, and while prostitution
         is
         				seen as a "necessary and insuperable evil."</p>
      <p>Consequently we do not believe in individual liberation. The fact that some of our
         				sisters are being promoted to important public positions or are gaining access
         to
         				professional and technical careers in increasingly greater numbers has nothing
         to do
         				with liberation. We believe that only structural change will produce real "women's
         				liberation."</p>
      <p>So our position, our actions, are aimed at contributing to the process of
         				transformation taking place in our country, at helping it strengthen and advance
         				without obstacles. We support this Revolution because it is anti-imperialist and
         				anti-oligarchic, and because it makes possible our own liberation.</p>
      <p>What do we call Cultural Revolution?</p>
      <p>The process by which the old system is entirely questioned and revised: its values,
         				behavior, habits, customs, institutions and forms of communication. A Cultural
         				Revolution must reject all individualism, engendering a collective way of life
         				harmonious with group ideals, while resistant to group egoism. A Cultural Revolution
         				must combat stereotypical attitudes like "maleism" (machismo) and "femaleism"
         				(hembrismo) —brute maleness and coy femaleness. A Cultural Revolution must change
         				patriarchal institutions like bourgeois marriage and the nuclear family—two
         				characteristic expressions of capitalism and the division of labor. Finally, a
         				Cultural Revolution's ultimate goal must be to change life, to culminate in a
         free
         				and humane socialism. </p>
      <p>Wanting to shape your own destiny is wanting to transform injustice.</p>
      <p>Wanting to transform injustice is being political.</p>
      <p> What do we want to be liberated from? From the social, economic, political, cultural
         				and moral conditions imposed by a patriarchal capitalist society which assigns
         us
         				secondary roles, condemning us to live as marginal beings passively supporting
         and
         				"servicing" men.</p>
      <p>From reformist paternalism which perpetually treats us as legal minors, because it
         				reduces  everything to the creation or amplification of protectionary
         				laws that are pretexts to mask our real situation of dependence on men and
         				second-class citizenship.</p>
      <p>From all kinds of ideological pressure, expressed in the terror most of us feel about
         				joining feminist organizations, under the assumption that if we do so, we must
         be
         				"against men.“ From the fear of being ridiculed or insulted as tomboys," "whores,"
         				or "dykes."</p>
      <p> Statistics affirm that few women are workers.</p>
      <p>Out of the home and onto the production lines! Working women also carry the burden
         of
         				the home!</p>
      <p>Communal eating-places, day-care centers and laundries—to create new jobs and lessen
         				the load of unpaid workers in the home.</p>
      <p>Being a mother and being fulfilled shouldn’t be a contradiction.</p>
      <p>We want family planning in hospitals, accessible to everyone. </p>
      <p> Against whom must we struggle?</p>
      <p>Against the Patriarchal-Capitalist System which determines an unjust society,
         				fostering exploitation, abuse, discrimination, hunger, wars and massacres; a system
         				which transforms woman into a beast of burden (if she is proletarian), or into
         a
         				luxury sex-object (if she is bourgeois). Capitalism has also reviled love, reduc¬
         				ing male-female relationships to economic factors or to mere social appearances.
         It
         				is a system in which children are the responsibility of individual couples and,
         in
         				actual practice, of the women alone.</p>
      <p>Against all sexist ideology which gains by reinforcing our situation as "different“
         				and which is expressed in the cult of "femininity“—sweetness, weakness, virginity
         				and motherhood as woman's only aim and destiny.</p>
      <p>And finally, against all threats to the liberation front whose ultimate goal is the
         				Monolithic Unity of Revolutionary Women, and of those men who integrally support
         the
         				cause of our liberation.</p>
