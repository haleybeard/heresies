         					Environment</h3>
      <h5><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/7712247/">Ruth E. Iskin</a></span></h5>
      <p> In early summer of 1975 1 was asked by the Women's Committee and the Office of Equal
         				Opportunity of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7712741">Aerospace Corporation</a> to curate an exhibition of women's art on the
         				subject of female experience. This seemed to me to offer the potential of reaching
         a
         				broad audience and avoiding the defensive reactions often attached to "feminist
         				art“ or "female sensibility“ in the art world. This art has been at the heart of an ongoing, often heated
         				controversy which has clouded the issues and obstructed direct perception of the
         				work. </p>
      <p>Female experience has been the starting point for the new art created by feminists
         				since 1969. Consciousness raising and other forms of women's communication,
         				sharing and group action, initiated as a result of the women's movement, made
         female
         				experience a rich source of subject matter and sparked the fresh energy with which
         				women are making art. For the show I selected the work of 15 L.A.
         					artists to represent both a broad
         				scope of women's experiences and a diversity of media, ranging from large environ¬
         				mental pieces to paintings, drawings, photography, prints, collage, assemblage,
         				and artists" books. In an attempt to build a bridge between the art and the
         				creators' intentions, I requested written statements from the artists, which,
         				along with biographical information, were available in a folder in the exhibition
         				area.</p>
      <p>The exhibition was on view from August 18th through September 5th in the Cafeteria
         				Conference Dining Rooms of the Aerospace Corporation. It was the first
         				exhibition of professional art on the company's grounds, preceded only by shows
         of
         				art by employees. Although sponsored and funded by the corporation, the show was
         				initiated by feminist employees who conceived it to offer "insight into the
         				emotional aspects of contemporary women.“ They
         				scheduled it to coincide with Women's Week, a program featuring prominent speakers
         				and entertainers.</p>
      <p>The management of Aerospace Corporation ("a non-profit research and development
         				corporation which provides technical direction of general systems of engineering,
         				primarily for the Air Force“) had been forced to develop new policies for hiring women in
         				order to meet affirmative-action requirements for receiving government funds.
         Women
         				are in the minority, constituting only 25% of the roughly 3,200 Aerospace employees.
         				Most of them (80%- 85%) are in lower-echelon clerical and secretarial positions;
         				only a few rank among the engineers, scientists, or chief administrators. The
         				company was, no doubt, hoping that the art exhibition and the activities of
         				Women's Week would go on record as testimony to their newfound good will toward
         				women. Much to my surprise, and to the dismay of the sponsors, the exhibition
         became
         				the focal point of hot debate. Violent emotional reactions, protest and support
         				quickly assumed the dimensions of a local scandal and echoed for months in letters
         				to the editor in The Orbiter, the company's newspaper.</p>
      <p>The art in the exhibition offered a feminist point of view on subject matter usually
         				treated from a male perspective. Though one might assume that the controversial
         				responses arose out of an alienation from contemporary art forms, it seems that
         the
         				conflict stemmed primarily from feminist content. None of the works included were blatantly
         				political protest art, yet they all reflected, to varying degrees, a new feminist
         				consciousness. It was this consciousness —judging from the reactions of many of
         				the female viewers—that was unfamiliar and threatening.</p>
      <p>We are accustomed to think of political art as crude, illustrative, or plainly
         				propagandistic, in contrast to "good/serious/modernist" art. It has of course
         been
         				pointed out that no art is entirely disconnected from its historical, political,
         				cultural, and geographical environment, and that therefore any art reflects these
         				conditions. However, feminist art is often labeled political art because the
         				consciousness it reflects is held by a minority, and it is at odds with the tacit
         				beliefs of those in power. The label "political art“ is used to demean the work
         				rather than to evaluate its artistic significance.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q441440">Judy Chicago</a>, the artist articulated her thoughts and
         				feelings about these issues:</p>The issue of politics for me arises at the point where my work interfaces with
      				culture; it does not arise at the point of origin in my studio. never think about
      				politics when ! make my art; rather 1 think about being true to my own impulses,
      				and for a woman to be true to her own impulses is, at this point in history, a
      				political act.... What ! challenge is the idea that masculinity is inherently
      				better than femininity; that hardness is better than softness, that defensiveness
      				is better than vulnerability, and  that violence is better than sharing. The assertion of womanhood is a
      				challenge to all these values that allow war dehumanization, rape, and art that
      				lacks relationship with reality to continue.
      <p><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5431238">Faith Wilding</a> elaborated on the relation between personal and political
         				change:</p>It has always been a tenet of the feminist movement that the personal is
      				political. It is political because when a person becomes transformed, enters into
      				public experience, and infuses her own experience into the publi c, the world
      becomes
      				transformed for her but in addition she then has the possibility of transforming
      				the world. We have witnessed too many people who are in politics who have never
      				experienced any kind of personal change or real vision.
      <p> What specifically triggered the controversy? The art in the exhibition included a
         				wide range of feminist work: parodies on public images of women (<span style="font-style:italic">Helen Alm Roth</span> and
         				<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5044669">Carole Caroompas</a>); private images of women and interior spaces (<span style="font-style:italic">Margaret Neilson</span>);
         				women's self-images integrated with their historical and mythological references
         				(<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q441440">Judy Chicago</a> and <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5431238">Faith Wilding</a>); references to women's vulnerability, powerless¬
         				ness, and powerfulness (<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108480540">Astrid Preston</a>); relics of admired female figures as magic
         				talismans (<span style="font-style:italic">Hazel Slawson</span>); communal efforts (Maria Karras); and the quilt/grid
         				pattern and color pink seen as tributes to women's collaborative forms (<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q13560673">Sheila de
            				Bretteville</a>).</p>
      <p>In her tableau environment Remnants in Homage to Lily Bart from <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q276032">Edith Wharton</a>'s <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6474536">House of Mirth</a>, <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q19668110">Nancy Youdelman</a> "reconstructed" a scene from the book with theatrical
         				grandeur and presence. The tableau represents the climax of Wharton's novel, when
         				Lily Bart, having lost her wealth and status kills herself. Hauntingly life-like,
         				her full-size figure, bearing the artist's own features reclines in bed. Her skin
         				tone is grayish and the sleeping drops that caused her death are by the side of
         her
         				bed. The tloor is cluttered with remnants of her life: letters photographs delicate
         				laces dresses, corsets, and veils. Youdelman creates metaphors (sleep, passivity,
         				death) for what have been essential aspects of female experience: economic
         				dependence on others, lack of ultimate control over one’s own life, victimization
         by
         				circumstances. In the guise of a 19th-century tragedy, Lily Bart's story is
         				emblematic for women who have remained powerless in society.</p>
      <p>In Youdelman's photographic series <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/nancy-youdelman-leaves-a-self-portrait">Leaves: A Self Portrait</a>, the artist is lying on
         				the ground, gradually being covered with leaves (from photograph to photograph)
         				until she is entirely buried:</p>It represented ways I felt; I felt numb all over, or like a sleepwalker,
      				something that could just disappear and 1 think that is that powerlessness in
      				female experience, sleep. There is also something esthetic about it; 1 love the
      				color of the leaves; it is about death and one could suppose that it might also
      mean
      				renewal.
      <p> Youdelman treads on precarious ground in presenting the passive female figure,
         				lying unconscious as horizontal female figures have so often been used in the
         				history of (male) art to entice the spectator by reminding him of his vertical
         				superiority. However Youdelman's tableau successfully evokes the solemn empathy
         of
         				the viewer who is confronted with the victims feelings about her powerlessness.</p>
      <p>In <span style="font-style:italic"><a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/133473">Jan Lester</a></span>'s tableau environment—Cats Enamoured Kits: Helpless Tom and Merciless Sex Kitten (1974)—two cats are anthropomorphized to enact a sexual-encounter
         				scene. The human environment, dress and behavior patterns throw into relief the
         				stereotyped patterns of men and women, only the roles are reversed. The female
         cat
         				plays the determined "attacker the seducer while the male cat withdraws with some
         				apprehension. At the same time, Lester sees her work as a manifestation of how
         women
         				are perceived when they take an active role in a situation:</p>The tableau had to do with sexual politics and with the female taking power. It
      				goes farther than just one sexual encounter, it goes out into the world in
      				general. It is one situation like a snapshot that makes it clear that this goes
      on n
      				al situations in society.
      <p><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28883455">Sherie Scheer</a>'s series—<span style="font-style:italic">Heavenly Visions</span>— depicts Fragonard-inspired images of her own
         				baby as a cherub floating in an infinite blue California sky. "Wherever they go,
         				they have no choice in it. ... The heavenly vision in which they appear is both
         				ideal and it is limbo." This reflects Scheer's own experience as a first-time
         				mother:</p>I found the child very sensual. It was unexpected to me what a strong female
      				biological experience it was to have a child, and then to be absolutely in love
      with
      				the child. In the course of using her as model, however, 1 made her cry, sometimes
      				neglected her, and in a way used her, both as a model and as inspiration. was
      aware
      				that the art that makes it in L.A. or made it at the time (two years ago) was
      				non-image-oriented and I am very image-oriented. 1 was also entirely aware that
      				showing babies in one's art was really outrageous and it gave me a devilish
      				pleasure, because think that a lot of art that makes it is empty formula and doesn’t
      				have any blood in it; it is not daring and it is not a turn-on either. So it was
      				like breaking a taboo, and especially for a woman artist.
      <p>Like Scheer <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/231144783102333361477/">Gilah Hirsch</a> deals with female power within its traditional domain. She
         				uses the imagery of food as "a secret biography, a metaphorical code.</p>The shape and color of food itself was so completely right and ripe for my own
      				feelings that it became a symbol for me; especially the tomato strawberry, and
      egg
      				became symbols for myself. These are expressed in scale and potency; it is a strange
      				word to use in relationship to an egg, a potent egg. The strawberry is one of
      the
      				few fruits that carries its seed on the outside, it is a vulnerable fruit; it
      is
      				juicy and has strength and vulnerability at the same time. Rather than feminist,
      				these paintings are, 1 think, more expressive of femaleness. It was a personal
      				statement for me....l can't separate my experience from a female experience; 1
      				feel powers in me, very specifically in certain centers in me.
      <p><a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7650894">Suzanne Lacy</a>'s book <a href="https://www.suzannelacy.com/rape-is#:~:text=Rape%20Is.-,(1972),the%20Happiness%20Is%20book%20genre.">Rape Is</a> (1972) has a white cover which becomes
         				bloody red on the inside. To open the book one must tear apart a red sticker labeled
         					"rape.“ Lacy's book names 21 instances of rape—not only as a
         				sexual violation but also as a series of psychological assaults:</p>Rape is when you are skipping home from school, and are surrounded suddenly by a
      				gang of large boys. Rape is when the man next door exposes himself and you feel
      				guilty for having looked. Rape is when you're walking alone, thinking your own
      				thoughts and a man driving by shouts "HI SWEETIE!"
      <p> The traditional representation of rape in art (with the exception of
         					<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q142472">Kollwitz</a>) represents the
         				experience of the rapist by focusing on his strength, activity and beauty, and
         				further removes rape from a realistic experience through mythological disguise.
         				Lacy first forces the viewer to enact a metaphorical rape ("deflowering" the book
         				by tearing the sticker) and then confronts the viewer with what rape means to
         its
         				victim.</p>
      <p>In <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q19802644">Karen Carson</a>'s drawings of beds (1971-75) woman is the bed. The drawings are
         				expressionistic in style and imagery, powerful as well as satirical statements
         				about the myth of happiness in sexual relationships. In this case, too, the
         				"disturbing“ feminist content of Carson's drawings arises from the art-historical
         				tradition of reclining female figures on beds and sofas. Many of these women become
         				an integral part of the inanimate, passive, yet sexually inviting surface on which
         				they are reclining. Unlike males Carson identifies with the oppressed— the
         				woman/bed—and at the same time, as artist, she takes active charge of that
         				surface, penetrates it with a giant screw (Screw), converts it into
         				a carton of eggs (Fasy Lay), severs it with a saw blade (Edge
         					of Night), or crowns it with a giant camera (Easy Shot).</p>
      <p>These surreal visualizations are take-offs on popular puns, which function as titles
         				and were often the starting points for the drawings. The series began as a macabre
         				though humorous comment on popular sexist consumerism. What emerges is a violent
         				denunciation of sexual roles, until finally the bed—former haven of consumer
         				pleasure—disintegrates from within (Cracking Up and Shattered
         					Dreams), smashing any illusions we might still have about bed and woman.
         				In these most recent drawings the formerly inanimate object erupts uncontrollably,
         				and its fragments fly into space. What is commonly labeled Women’s Liberation
         is
         				in fact, as Carson expresses it, an excruciatingly painful process beginning with
         				the recognition of exterior oppression, leading to the experience of oppression
         				from within and finally building toward a complex re-integration—represented by
         the
         				artist's new work—collages in which the torn and mutilated fragments are reunited
         on
         				a cohesive surface.</p>would say that these drawings were intentionally propagandistic.... It had to
      				do with consumer and sexual politics. The frame of mind that ! was in when I did
      				these drawings was severe frustration over treatment by men. The drawings were
      also
      				politically charged for me because ! talked about them to all kinds of groups
      from
      				Valley housewives to a continuation high school culture-hour class; thought people
      				would be bored by these drawings and they weren’t. They seemed to have a
      				good time, and related to the drawings immediately. Now, it is not necessary to
      				have a good time when viewing art, but there was blanket recognition of the issues.
      				When 1 looked in the newspaper I noticed that you could apply sexual politics,
      				directly or indirectly, to almost every image in the advertisement world; every
      				image implies sexual oromises. My original fantasy was that ! would have enough
      				money to take out a full page ad in the L.A. Times, and just change the images
      a
      				little bit. Obviously the most political thing about that was my fantasy about
      how
      				many people 1 could reach that way. It is the nature of good political art to
      be
      				recognizable and understandable by a lot of people and maybe at a visceral level
      				too. Political art is often satirical, and probably most effective at that
      				level.
      <p>The exhibition provided an opportunity to witness the heightened impact of
         				contemporary feminist art when viewed by a "non-art“ audience—a cross-section
         of
         				middle America that normally would not encounter art, and specifically by a female
         				audience alienated from feminism. (The negative response came primarily from
         					women)
         				It can also be seen as a test case for implementing a long-desired goal —bringing
         				art into a public daily work environment.</p>
      <p>Had the show at Aerospace been exhibited in any number of established or alternative
         				gallery spaces, it probably would not have caused unusual debate, and certainly
         it
         				would not have prompted any doubt about the artistic merit of the work. In the Cafeteria Conference Rooms
         				of Aerospace, however, the exhibit infiltrated a male environment that ordinarily
         				would not display women's work made from a feminist perspective and certainly
         				would not give it public acclaim. The work was predominantly considered
         				scandalous: it engendered passionate objections and firm negative judgments. The
         				show was labeled pornography rather than art by people who were unlikely ever
         to
         				have considered what is or isn’t art.</p>
      <p>This disclaimer was the protesters' attempt to dismiss such threatening and upsetting
         				material. Casting it as pornography implied that the art lacked any real esthetic
         				value and therefore need not be taken seriously. The level of naiveté of the
         				critical responses—when opposed to the more sophisticated criticism to which we
         are
         				accustomed from much of the art world— was refreshing in its directness. One letter
         				of protest stated:</p>I object to the Art Exhibition. 1 find it degrading. As a woman, and hopefully
      				a lady, find it extremely offensive. 1am unable to lower my sights to the gutter
      				level of this exhibit. In my opinion, it is lewd, vulgar, obscene and immoral.
      				Since when did good taste and modesty go out-of-style?
      <p> In another letter signed by 36 people-almost a petition—the art was called:</p>...in poor taste, bad character, and a definite infringement on the rights of all
      				women anc men who give sex the dignity, respect and honor that was intended for
      the
      				human race. The Aerospace Corporation has drastically changed its practices since
      				the 1960s to allow this type of "smut“ to be exhibited, and the employees were
      				encouraged through desk-to-desk distribution and advertising to view the
      				exhibition.<br /> We are sure that with much less expense to the Company, the
      				representatives... could have arranged for a display of pornography, pictures
      and
      				books from one of the adult bookstores in the Los Angeles Area, and at a lower
      				insurance premium. The Aerospace Women's Committee does not speak for all of the
      				female employees, as there are those of us who still adhere to the old principle
      				that we were liberated immediately when we were born in America, we enjoy being
      				treated as a woman and we are definitely Miss or Mrs. and not Ms.
      <p>Clearly these female viewers at Aerospace "saw" in the art their own worst fears of
         				feminism. Their objections though focused on the exhibition, were rooted in their
         				alienation from the organized women's movement. Confronted by art that dealt with
         an
         				oppression familiar in most of their lives, real images that did not correspond
         to
         				the illusion of the American dream presented a powerful threat.</p>
      <p>The art was perceived as offensive precisely because it was not placed in a
         				neutralizing environment like a gallery, where viewers can easily hide behind
         				anonymity. The art invaded their own daily working sphere where it threatened
         how
         				they were viewed in their professional positions. Brought into the work context,
         the
         				art reflected more directly upon them. The heightened emotional reactions caused
         a
         				strong need to disassociate themselves verbally from the picture of womanhood
         				presented in the show.</p>
      <p>While identification with female experiences and values is threatening in any
         				situation in a patriarchal society, such identification may be virtually impossible
         				when introduced into a work environment dominated by male values and power. Such
         an
         				environment, by implication, and as a condition for the possibility of working
         				there, demands a woman's identification with patriarchy over a recognition of
         her
         				own oppression. To admit that what was expressed in the art is real—women's
         				powerlessness and powerfulness their sexual feelings and experiences, and the
         fact
         				that women are rape victims—is to shatter the very myth that has sustained
         				traditional womanhood all along. It is admitting publicly to an embarrassing,
         				private part of woman's experience which she has attempted to conceal even from
         				herself in an effort to preserve the "human dignity" of which  she is
         				robbed daily. This response is one we all felt during initial stages of our
         				feminism, when we first became conscious of the shame and self-dislike we had
         buried
         				for so long, before we were ready to reshape our own feelings by taking pride
         in
         				ourselves other women, and art that dealt with these subjects.</p>
      <p>The reactions of the women at Aerospace are not, I suspect, uncommon. I doubt very
         				much that a minority of Black workers in a predominantly white work environment
         				would find it any easier to respond to an exhibition of art exposing painful aspects
         				of the experience of being Black in American society; or that Detroit factory
         				workers for example, readily identify with the realistic presentation in Rivera’s
         				mural of the hardships of factory work. There is, however an important
         				difference between the situation of women and other workers. Regardless of their
         				status, women are subject to their oppression as women which crosses class
         				boundaries. In âddition to their job or profession—whether factory worker teacher
         				nurse, doctor engineer or scientist—women still do the unpaid, endless, menial
         labor
         				of housework, bear children and carry the sole responsibility of raising them.
         All
         				women are potential rape victims, and all women live in a male-dominated society
         				which is based on various cultural versions of enslavement and denies women's
         					culture.</p>
      <p>Those women who had not attempted to step out of female role-conditioning in their
         				jobs at Aerospace were more oppressed than other workers because they received
         lower
         				wages and had lower professional status. They were the most offended by the show
         The
         				middle-class women who rebelled against female role-conditioning in their jobs
         at
         				Aerospace (the engineers programmers scientists) were the only ones who had
         				developed a feminist consciousness and reacted favorably to the exhibition. For
         				example, in a letter of support, one woman expressed her response to the exhibition
         				and the protesters' views:</p>That women have suffered personally and professionally from conditions ranging
      				from lack of opportunity to manipulation and even exploitation on the basis that
      				they are women is uncomfortable to face.<br /> The Art Exhibition, a high quality
      				collection of some very honest and courageous works, was unusually rich in content
      				for those of us who in some way or another have "been there." Although there was
      a
      				deliberate intent to shock, it was as a means to focus emotionally on the art;
      it
      				was not propagandistic. These are personal and esthetic interpretations of some
      of
      				the hard truths encountered by women, and the obscenity lies in the fact that
      				these wrongs arise because of wide-range departure from good human values.<br />
      				Those who want to oppose smut should look for it in our politics, in our mores,
      in
      				the management of our corporations, in our personal relationships.
      <p>In her review of the exhibition <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18207039">Melinda Worz</a> concluded:</p>The Female Experience in Art offers a wide panorama of contemporary women's
      				attitudes. It is gratifying to see such a high quality showoutside the established
      				sacred halls of art, as part of a working environment.
      <p>In thinking now about this exhibition, 1 realize that it was unrealistic to expect
         an
         				enthusiastic reception, or even acceptance, for art like this among female viewers
         				who were not already feminists or somewhat sympathetic to feminism. It might have
         				seemed that the work was not perceived for what it was—but on the contrary it
         was
         				in fact accurately perceived, and found objectionable. Such response is typical
         when
         				feminism is introduced into a male-dominated culture.</p>
      <p>For those women at Aerospace who were sympathetic to feminism, the exhibition was
         a
         				positive experience providing a new awareness of the existence of women's culture
         				created by contemporary feminists. In that sense the exhibition did broaden the
         				audience for contemporary feminist art. For some of these women who previously
         had
         				no particular interest in art, the exhibition was a beginning of what has since
         				become an ongoing interest and commitment to women's art.</p>I am still thinking about one piece in the show which 1 would like to own if 1
      				had money. decided that if 1 bought art, it would be women's art because of my
      				commitment to feminist artists.
      <p>Earlier that same summer, my colleagues and in <span style="font-style:italic">the Feminist Studio Workshop</span> had come
         				to a collective definition of feminist art based on our goals, experiences and
         				observation of our students' work. We defined the function of feminist art as
         				raising consciousness inviting dialogue, and transforming culture. It became clear
         				to me that both the individual art exhibited at Aerospace and the exhibition as
         a
         				whole in fact realized these goals to the extent that was possible in that time
         and
         				space. </p>
