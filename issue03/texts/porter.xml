			<byline>Translated by <persName key="Margaret Porter" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q76031620">Margaret Porter</persName></byline>


			<epigraph>
				<p>Natalie Barney stood at the center of that group we usually refer to as "the
					Paris lesbians." Famous for both her love affairs and her literary salon,

					Barney's circle included <persName key="Gertrude Stein" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q188385">Gertrude Stein</persName>, <persName key="Romaine Brooks" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q466607">Romaine Brooks</persName>, <persName key="Djuna Barnes" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q234721">Djuna Barnes</persName> and
					<persName key="Colette" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q218679">Colette</persName>, as well as <persName key="Jean Cocteau" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q83158">Jean Cocteau</persName>, <persName key="André Gide" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47484">Andre Gide</persName>, <persName key="Ezra Pound" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q163366">Ezra Pound</persName>, and others.</p>
				<p>Barney was a writer herself but little of her work has appeared in English, and
					she is more talked about than read. She was alive until 1972 but remains
					enigmatic, a "legend," the blonde Amazon who rode horseback in the <placeName key="Bois de Boulogne" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q209626">Bois de
					Boulogne</placeName> every morning. “She was charming, wrote <persName key="Sylvia Beach" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q265562">Sylvia Beach</persName> in <orgName key="Shakespeare and Company" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1503157">Shakespeare and
					Company</orgName>. “Many of her sex found her fatally so... The following excerpt from one

					of her last books chronicles an important relationship in Barney's life, that
					with poet <persName key="Renée Vivien" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q275628">Renée Vivien</persName>.</p>

			</epigraph>
			<p>One evening Renée invited me for the first time into her room at the family boarding
				house, rue Crevaux. “To render it worthy of my coming" she had filled il with
				lilies, the flower that she had dedicated to me: "You will wither one day, ah! My
				lily!</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, it was the lilies which were withering. There were some of them in a too
				narrow jar of water and even on her bed. Their whiteness illuminated the somber
				corners of the room: it was a splendor, a suffocation, transforming this ordinary
				room into an ardent and virginal chapel inclining us toward genuflection-she before
				me, I before her.</p>
			<p>I left her at dawn. The snow, last innocence of winter, had disappeared, but a light
				frost covered the ground where my footsteps imprinted themselves on this pallor
				between her street and mine.</p>
			<p>Disturbing beginnings where two young girls sought each other by way of a love badly
				shared.</p>
			<p>The yet somnolent senses of Renée scarcely responded to my desires; her budding love,
				exalted by imagination, appropriated my role of lover-poet. After each rendezvous,
				"for the night was to us as to others the day," I received from her flowers and
				poems, from which 1 choose these several fragments as so many avowals retracing the
				beginnings of our strange liaison:</p>

			<lg>
				<l>See, I am of the age when the virgin abandons her hand</l>
				<l>To the man that her weakness looks for and fears</l>
				<l>And 1 have not chosen a companion of the route</l>
				<l>Because you appeared at the turning of the way.</l>
			</lg>
			<lg>
				<l>I feel tremble on my mute lips</l>
				<l>The gentleness and fright of your first kiss.</l>
				<l>Under your step, I hear the breaking of lyres...</l>
			</lg>
			<lg>
				<l>With what kisses charm the languor of your soul...</l>
				<l>With what rhythms of love, with what fervent poem</l>
				<l>Honor worthily her whose beauty</l>
				<l>Wears Desire on her forehead like a diadem?</l>
			</lg>
			<p>Embarrassed by this excess of adoration, to which 1 would have preferred joys better
				shared, I loved how- ever the verses that she wrote to me. 1 rendered count that
				this attitude of adoration, for which I was the pretext, was necessary to her, and
				that without really knowing me, she found, thanks to me, a new theme of inspiration
				to succeed death and solitude: love—but love under an aspect which, since Sappho,
				had scarcely found a poet.</p>
			<p><persName key="Renée Vivien" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q275628">Renée Vivien</persName> had just offered me a whole notebook written in the hand of a good
				scholar whose writing had not yet taken flight. Under the cover on parchment where
				figured a lily and a lyre of doubtful taste, she had inscribed: “To Natalie, for her
				alone." After reading and rereading her verses, inspired by me and surpassing my
				own, I wanted them to be published. Renée, who however "aspired to glory”—for she
				had a more lofty idea of it than I—consented to see them appear, but on condition
				that she sign her book only “R. Vivien. When this first collection of verse
				appeared, from <orgName key="Alphonse Lemerre" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17518122">Alphonse Lemerre</orgName>, and under this initial could pass for that of a
				masculine first name, a young lecturer who flattered himself on discovering and
				launching future geniuses, took as subject these Etudes et Preludes and declared to
				his audience “how one feels the verses vibrant with love written by a very young man
				idola- There was, in fact, cause to trous of a first mistress. misunderstand:</p>
			<lg>
				<l>You touch without embracing like the chimera...</l>
				<l>Your form is a gleam that leaves the hands empty...</l>
			</lg>
			<p>As he continued his lecture on this gift, Renée and I seized with foolish laughter,
				had to precipitously leave the hall. No one in the audience could guess the cause of
				this brusque departure.</p>
			<pb n="66" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue03/Issue3_images/issue3_068.jpg"/>
			<p> As they began to ask my poetess for interviews and meetings, she feared being
				invaded and had herself represented by a governess of an aspect as anti-poetic as
				possible. This one had to make herself pass for <persName key="Renée Vivien" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q275628">Renée Vivien</persName>, which discouraged
				future pursuits and enthu- siasms, for the rumor spread that the author of a work so
				troubling was deprived of all charm, eloquence or physical attraction.</p>
			<p>A short time after, she took me to her home in London, where I was able to find in
				the celebrated book- store of <orgName key="The Bodley Head" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2908391">Bodley Head</orgName> a copy of the fragments of Sappho,
				translated by Wharton (no connection with my compatriot the novelist Edith Wharton,
				who would have trembled with horror at the idea of a possible confusion). This
				precious collection served <persName key="Renée Vivien" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q275628">Renée Vivien</persName> for comparison with her French translation;
				it became her bedside book and the source from which she drew the pagan inspiration
				for several of her books to come. One is not pagan who wishes to be: I felt already
				in her a Christian soul which was ignored. While I leafed through other books, <persName key="Lane, John Bryant" ref="http://vocab.getty.edu/ulan/500013603" cert="low">John
				Lane</persName>, the editor-publisher pointed out Opale, the first book of verse of a young
				poetess of <placeName key="Norfolk" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23109">Norfolk</placeName>, whose second collection he was going to publish soon.</p>
			<p>Several of these poems pleased me to the point that l wrote to their author, adding
				to my word of admiration Etude et Preludes and Quelques Portraits—Sonnets de Femmes.
				Opale responded with fire:</p>
			<lg>
				<l>..For I would dance to make you smile, and sing</l>
				<l>Of those who with some sweet mad sin have played,</l>
				<l>And how Love walks with delicate feet afraid</l>
				<l>Twixt maid and maid.</l>
			</lg>
			<p>"Why," I said to Renée, “shouldn’t we assemble around us a group of poetesses like
				those who surrounded Sappho at <placeName key="Mytilene" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189059">Mytilene</placeName> and who mutually inspired each other?</p>
			<p>This project pleased her so much that we began to realize it by suggesting to Opale

				to come to be near us in <persName key="Paris" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q90">Paris</persName>, where we were returning to install ourselves in a

				small hotel on the rue Alphonse-de-Neuville, next to that of the Rostands. My
				parents reluctantly let me do it, but only after imposing on me, as chaperone, a
				housekeeper who had already been mine in a pension where I stayed when I was in
				transit at Paris. It is she, besides, who presented herself under the name of Renée
				to discourage the curious. The sympathetic Professor B.C. was also hired to teach
				Greek to Renée in view of a translation into French verse that she wished to do of
				the fragments of Sappho. After her lesson, he corrected for me a new book that 1 was
				preparing: Five Little Greek Dialogues. I made use also of his learned and difficult
				penmanship for a transcription of my Letters to a Known, in which I resumed my
				adventure with Liane. This work finished, I removed the ring that she had ordered
				for me at <placeName key="Lalique" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2406369">Lalique</placeName>, and which carried, engraved on the inside: "It pleases me so much
				that you endure to understand and love me.</p>
			<p>Renée wrote two versions of our novel lived: A Woman Appeared to Me. Influenced by
				the bad taste of our "belle epoque, she gave me the impression of ceding to the
				worst weaknesses of the “art nouveau. This poet hardly possesses the gift of a
				novelist and cannot, consequently, lend life either to the one or to the other of
				her heroines.</p>
			<p>The first version, Vally, was composed when we were entangled, and the second when
				she restored to me the name "Lorely.</p>
			<p>Vally and Lorely have the same undulating body and similar eyes “of ice under hair
				like moonlight.</p>
			<p>The author doubtless wished to create an impression of magic, but the magic refused
				to operate and it was absurdity that replaced it. To give weight to this afflicting
				affirmation, I pick this detail of a decor that she must have believed bewitching: A
				dried-out serpent entwined itself around a vase wherein some black irises withered."
				While “dressed in a white robe that veiled me while revealing me, 1 unstrung some
				opals, plucked petals from some orchids...</p>
			<p>I should reproach Renée for the first of these fatal and artificial women made to
				resemble me, for in her second novel, from the mouth of this heroine, she makes me
				say, "In truth, each being becomes parallel to the appearance that our perversity
				forms of her: fear, by force of not comprehending me, to render me
				incomprehensible." In one of these books, she declares me "incapable of loving. I
				who have never been capable of anything but that! Opposing my love of love against
				her love of death, Renée esteems that I have had, by access only, to submit to this
				evil of the nineteenth century, spleen, while she herself has made it the leitmotif
				of her life and her work.</p>
			<p>That she had wished to go astray to such a point in suffering, proves to me how much
				her poetic genius had need of it.</p>
			<p>Throughout the false mysticism by which she seems haunted, in a flash of lucidity she
				recognizes in me a reposing pagan soul. She recounts, in A Woman Appeared to Me,
				that I asked her on the day preceding Christmas, “What is this festival of
				Christmas? Does it commemorate the birth or the death of Christ?” Exaggeration for
				exaggeration, I prefer that to other distortions.</p>
			<p>On rereading these two novels, I have the painful impression of having posed for a
				bad portraitist.</p>

			<p> Barney relates next how she and Vivien traveled to <placeName key="New York" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1384">New York</placeName> and to the Barney home
				in Bar Harbor after the death of their friend Violette. Renee was deeply depressed.
				She continued her study of classical Greek with the hope of translating Sappho,
				while Barney attended dinners and balls at the will of her parents. After a visit to
				<placeName key="Bryn Mawr College" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q995265">Bryn Mawr College</placeName>, the two separated in tears—Vivien to return to Europe and Barney

				to go to her parents home in <placeName key="Washington, D.C." ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q61">Washington, D.C</placeName>., for she had promised to spend the
				winter with them.</p>
			<p>I wrote in vain to Renée who, according to Mary S., had just installed herself in the
				large apartment on the ground floor and not in the little apartment planned and
				prepared at great expense by our governess. Mary S. saw her only in passing, so
				greatly busy was Renée with furnishing it in an original manner.</p>
			<p>Was it this moving which prevented Renée from answering my letters? Or was it her
				book Evocations which had just appeared and which she had sent to me? Uneasy, I
				tried to understand through this book what could have provoked her silence:
				sometimes, reassured by her poems "for Atthis"—Atthis being one of the little names
				that she had given me—but surprised at being evoked in the past tense:</p>
			<lg>
				<l>For I remember divine expectations,</l>
				<l>The shadow, and the feverish evenings of yesterday...</l>
				<l>Amidst sighs and ardent tears,</l>
				<l>I loved you, Atthis.</l>
			</lg>
			<p>Several descriptive stanzas followed preceding this finale:</p>
			<lg>
				<l>Here is what breathes and mounts with the flame,</l>
				<l>And the flight of songs and the breath of lilies,</l>
				<l>The intimate sob of the soul of my soul:</l>
				<l>I loved you, Atthis.</l>
			</lg>
			<p>What is it that prevented a like feeling for living? I chafed with impatience and
				apprehension, attached to my duty of worldly frivolities without personal resources

				to escape. Finally, in the springtime, I returned to Paris with my family. Before
				even going up to my room in the <placeName key="Hôtel d'Albe" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q106752331">Hotel D’Albe</placeName>, I precipitated myself to <placeName key="Avenue du Bois" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2651457">Avenue du
				Bois</placeName>, where the concierge informed me that Mademoiselle went out just a moment

				ago.</p>
			<p>I waited in the courtyard of Number 23. My heart beating, I perceived her finally
				arriving in an automobile and ran before it, when she gave the order to her
				chauffeur to go out again by the court at the end without stopping. Was it possible
				that she had not seen me? Or that she did not wish to see me? With a leap, I went to
				Violette’s sister’s house. Mary received me gently, but could not or would not
				inform me on this mystery. I spent some hours near her, in the hope that Renée would
				come up unexpectedly, and from this apartment situated just above that of Renée, I
				spied her apparition in the little garden. Fearing that the perfidious governess had
				intercepted the letter in which 1 announced my coming, I wished to have my heart
				clear about it and I had it, in fact, that same evening. Renee descended into her
				little garden accompanied by é sturdy person. The manner in which this person
				surrounded her with her arm left no ambiguity about their intimacy. She had then
				conquered Renée, but how? Certainly not by her physical appearance. Perhaps, under
				all that fat had she not only the authoritarian visage of a Valkyrie but a heart of
				gold? Renée had never aspired to all the useless luxury with which the new chosen
				one was surrounding her, her personal fortune having always more than sufficed for
				her needs. Who then could profit from this prodigality, if not our astute
				governess?</p>
			<p>I prayed my friend <persName key="Calvé, Emma" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/6824159248400704870009/">Emma Calve</persName>—who suffered equally from an abandonment and whom 1 had
				sought to comfort at the time of her triumphal tour in Carmen in the <placeName key="United States of America" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q30">United
				States</placeName>—to lend me her irresistible voice and when night came, we disguised ourselves
				as street singers. She sang under the French windows of Renee Vivien: "I have lost
				my Eurydice, nothing can match my sorrow, while 1 pretended to pick up the pieces of
				money thrown from the other floors. Finally, Renée partly opened her glass door to
				better listen to this surprising voice which was attacking the celebrated aria: Love
				is the child of Bohemia which has never known law. The moment having come, 1 threw
				my poem attached to a bouquet over the gate of the garden, so that she could see and
				pick it up. But as some passersby began to surround us, we had to eclipse ourselves
				in the shadow before my chanteuse, recognized in the shadow thanks to her voice, was
				pursued by applause. I soon received a reply to my sonnet from the governess, and
				not from Renée as I had hoped. Having collected verses and bouquets “destined to a
				person whom she had the good fortune to have in charge, the governess “prayed me to
				cease these dispatches, as distressing as they are useless."</p>
			<p>If it is true that sentiments are not commanded on order, it is even more true that
				they are not countermanded! My rage having no equal but my anguish. sent an S.O.S.
				to Eva,<note>A childhood friend of Natalie’s, probably her first lover.</note> who
				arrived at once to be near me. Horrified to find me in such a state of despair, she
				went to plead my cause with Renée, who refused to see <pb n="68" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue03/Issue3_images/issue3_070.jpg"/> me again. Her
				existence ("since it is, it appears, necessary to live”) must suit her so according
				to all appearances, for she knew me bound to her flight and obsessed by her verses,
				while she, inspired by my memory, had no further need to be troubled by my
				presence.</p>
			<p>I learned then the machinations of our governess. Abusing the credulous jealousy of
				Renée, she had persuaded her—with proofs to give it weight—that one of my suitors,
				the Count de la Palisse, had gone to the United States for the unique purpose of
				marrying me. How had Renée been able to believe such an absurdity? Perhaps because
				she violently repulsed the least advance of her suitors she understood nothing of my
				complaisances, and more, that the company of intelligent men interested and pleased
				me often more than that of a pretty woman? In general, I remained the fraternal
				friend of men. Why, besides, this “angry opposition' between Sodom and Gomorrah,
				instead of a sympathy without equivocation?</p>
			<p>Balanced and sociable, I could not foresee the unreasonable changes of Renée, and I
				remained profoundly afflicted by them.</p>
			<p>The crude ruse of our governess had moreover succeeded in throwing the poor and
				unhappy Renée into the arms of another! By what intrigues or what chance had those
				arms proved to be those of one of the richest women of the Israelite world? This
				strong and willful person was not only known for her prejudiced tastes, but for
				endowing her successive mistresses with a sumptuous dwelling and a life annuity.
				This prodigality did not explain to me why Renée, who already had a considerable
				fortune, had fallen into this gilded trap.</p>

			<p> Our governess, after expensively furnishing the little apartment chosen and
				abandoned, had presided over the luxurious fitting-out of this large ground floor
				where all passed through her intervention, which did not prevent her from touching
				some wages as watch dog of the captive. A voluntary captive perhaps and one who,
				after the death of Violette and the lies adroitly accumulated against me, had
				immense need of quiet and security.</p>
			<p>It was then that I received a dispatch from an Austrian princess, with whom Eva and I

				were connected. She alerted me that she had just arrived alone at <placeName key="Bayreuth" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3923">Bayreuth</placeName>. We

				departed then for the Wagnerian Festival, where we were able to procure two seats,
				thanks to connections of the princess. From the first presentation of the Tetralogy,
				I spotted Renée and contemplated her from our balcony. Eva went down right away to
				tell her that I was waiting for her up above. Renée, giving her place to Eva, came
				to sit beside me. Both being invaded by this music, our eyes, then our hands met in
				the shadow, and we found ourselves so again each evening.</p>
			<p>On telling me farewell she promised me, tears in her eyes, to arrange to find me
				again before the end of this same month of August. Our rendezvous was set at Vienna,
				from where we would continue the trip together on the Orient Express toward
				<placeName key="Mytilene" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189059">Mytilene</placeName>, by way of <placeName key="Constantinople" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q16869">Constantinople</placeName>.</p>
			<p>This time she kept her word and I found her again with an unbounded exaltation but I
				had to hold back, for she remained on the defensive. However, she identified me with
				her cult for <placeName key="Lesbos" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q128087">Lesbos</placeName>, in writing:</p>
			<lg>
				<l>Sweetness of my songs, let us go toward <placeName key="Mytilene" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189059">Mytilene</placeName>.</l>
				<l>Here is where my soul has taken its flight.</l>
			</lg>
			<lg>
				<l>Let us go toward the welcome of the adored virgins.</l>
				<l>Our eyes will know the tears of returnings;</l>
				<l>We shall see at last fade away the countries</l>
				<l>Of the lifeless loves.</l>
			</lg>
			<p>How important to her was this decor! But then I would have been content to be with
				her no matter where, away from the world, on condition that I found her there
				completely.</p>
			<p>Thus I was less disappointed than she in perceiving that isle that Countess Sabini
				had described to us as having "the shape of a lyre spread on the sea. At the
				approach to <placeName key="Mytilene" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189059">Mytilene</placeName> we heard a phonograph from the port nasalizing, “Come poupoule,
				come poupoule, come." Renée, who had been waiting since dawn on the bridge, paled
				with horror. When we trod that dust consecrated by the sandals of Sappho and her
				poetesses we regained awareness of our pilgrimage, despite the modern eruptions.</p>
			<p>I kept myself from remarking to her that at Lesbos, far from encountering the Greek
				type of the beautiful companions of Sappho, we saw not a single woman of that
				lineage, but only some handsome stevedores, fishermen and shepherds. The remainder
				of the population had their traits as bastardized as their language, in which Renée
				found no longer the accent of classic Greek.</p>
			<p>But the little rustic hotel which received us kept an ancient simplicity, with its
				water pots of baked clay and its good cooking in olive oil, served by an old
				domestic <pb n="69" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue03/Issue3_images/issue3_071.jpg"/> who had her head encircled by a band and was followed by a
				bald dog without age.</p>
			<p>The nights were more beautiful than all those we had known, and from the first, what
				a cry of victory l had to stifle!</p>
			<lg>
				<l>Receive into your orchards a feminine couple,</l>
				<l>Isle melodious and friendly to caresses..</l>
				<l>Amidst the Asiatic odor of heavy jasmine,</l>
				<l>You have not at all forgotten Sappho nor her Mistresses...</l>
				<l>Isle melodious and friendly to caresses,</l>
				<l>Receive in your orchards a feminine couple...</l>
			</lg>
			<p>The next day the entire island offered itself to us like an open bed. Spread out in
				the sun on some wide banks of soft algae, breathing the salt air, we continued to
				dream on this murmuring shore of the <placeName key="Aegean Sea" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34575">Aegean Sea</placeName>. Renee, in her poem on <placeName key="Mytilene" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189059">Mytilene</placeName>,
				describes it :</p>
			<lg>
				<l>When disposing their bodies on beds of dry algae</l>
				<l>The lovers fling tired and broken words,</l>
				<l>You mingled your odors of roses and peaches</l>
				<l>With the long whisperings that follow kisses..</l>
				<l>In our turn tossing words tired and broken,</l>
				<l>We dispose our bodies on your beds of dry algae...</l>
			</lg>
			<p>Without the community of Orientals installed in their summer villas, we would have
				been able to believe our- selves in the fifth century B.C. Renée acquired some
				medals of that epoch, struck in the image of Sappho.</p>
			<p>In the enchantment of this sojourn, without messenger and without other souvenir, we
				rented two little villas joined by the same orchard, for Renée had resolved to never
				leave Mytilene. She would wait for me "faithfully and without budging" if, later, I
				had business elsewhere.</p>
			<p>"I have yet less business elsewhere than you, replied imprudently, for this reminder
				made her contract her fine eyebrows. I then came up with an idea 1 knew worthy of
				pleasing her: "Why shouldn’t we form here that school of poetry so dreamed of where
				those who vibrate with poetry, youth and love would come to us, such as those poets
				of yesterday arriving from all parts to surround Sappho?"</p>
			<p>Renée was in fact seduced by that perspective. Installed in the larger of the two
				villas, she worked again on her translation of Sappho, which was nearly
				finished.</p>
			<p>But Atthis, where is she?" I said.</p>
			<p>Atthis is present here, she replied, taking out of her bag Five Little Greek
				Dialogues and also the manuscript of Je me Souviens that I had sent to her at
				<placeName key="Bayreuth" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3923">Bayreuth</placeName>. This manuscript had neighbored with her cold cream and carried the trace
				of it on the parchment of the cover. Before it gets damaged more, it is necessary
				that we publish it."</p>
			<p>"I wrote it for you alone"</p>
			<p>Also, you see, it has not left me.</p>
			<p>Opening my little book of Dialogues, I saw that she had underlined there certain
				passages concerning Sappho and, intrigued, I reread:</p>
			<p>Do you believe that she was so irresistible as they have said?</p>
			<p>"She was irresistible as all those who have followed their nature. She is as all
				those who have dared to live. She is as irresistible as Destiny itself."</p>
			<p>"Why did she truly love only women?"</p>
			<p>"Because only women are complex enough to attract her and fleeting enough to hold
				her. They alone know how to give her all the ecstasies and all the torments.... It
				is in ourselves that we lose ourselves and in others that we find ourselves again. I
				believe her more faithful in her inconstancy than the others in their constant
				fidelity."</p>
			<p>Leaning on my shoulder to read the text with me, Renée murmured in my ear:</p>
			<p>"That Sappho there, she is you."</p>
			<p>"That which describes one is not what one is, but that which one would wish to
				be.</p>
			<p>"That which we shall become, and so that ’someone in the future will remember
				us.'"</p>
			<p>"Thanks to your translation of Sappho and also to that of her poetesses, I shall
				write a play for which I have already determined the plot and which will destroy the
				myth of Phaon, for Sappho will die in it as she ought: because the most beloved of
				her friends will have betrayed her."</p>
			<p>"Do not speak of betrayal nor of mourning ’in the house of the poet where mourning
				does not enter.'"</p>
			<p>...We knew that at the hotel our mail waited for us. Avoid it? But then where spend
				the night? From our entry into the hotel, a parrot greeted us with a strident and
				mocking voice, and the concierge, taking our names, handed us our mail. Throw it in
				the sea without even taking cognizance of it? But then, uneasy at our silence, would
				they not come to disturb us? Would it not be better to open it and perhaps respond
				to it? A letter from Renée’s friend announced her desire to visit this celebrated
				island and make to rendezvous shortly at <pb n="70" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue03/Issue3_images/issue3_072.jpg"/> Constantinople. Renée had only
				time to send her a telegram to prevent her from taking the Orient Express, advising
				her that she was already on the return route. Was it not more loyal to have her
				learn in person of Renée’s intention of breaking with her than to give her the shock
				of such a decision in a telegram which, at any rate, would not stop her? She was of
				those who will not let loose or be deceived without struggle. She would arrive,
				therefore, and then what scenes would we have to undergo? I suggested hiding
				ourselves "no matter where away from the world."</p>
			<p>"She would alert the consulate, the secret police of the entire world. Her power,
				like her fortune, is unlimited and even if you went away and 1 let her come, instead
				of tiring of such a life, she would clamp onto it. If she sus pected anything she
				would install herself in your place. And that, I would not endure."</p>
			<p>It was necessary then to leave in order to return to living in peace and to
				developing without fear or constraint our beautiful project. But meanwhile, from the
				next day, we had to resign ourselves to once again taking the boat which had brought
				us.</p>
			<p>Like so many other lovers, we still had those "bad farewells from which one returns”
				and those recoveries exultant and without duration.</p>
			<p>Unattached, then irresistibly attracted one toward the other only to lose each other
				anew, our persistent love underwent all the phases of a mortal attachment that
				perhaps death alone would be able to conclude.</p>
			<p>I always loved Renée but with a vanquished love, enslaved by the circumstances that
				she had permitted to get the better of us:</p>
			<lg>
				<l>Your clear gaze troubles and confuses me..</l>
				<l>Yes, I know it, 1 was wrong in many circumstances,</l>
				<l>And very piteously, I blush before you,</l>
				<l>But everywhere sorrow has hemmed me in and pursued me.</l>
				<l>Do not blame me anymore then! rather console me</l>
				<l>For having so badly lived my lamentable life.</l>
			</lg>
			<p>Thanks to that “lamentable life," and to the happiness that she lacked, she has
				become what she has always wished to be: a great poet.</p>
			<p>In reading, “La Venus des Aveugles" and “Aux Heures des mains jointes” I found how
				much these verses had strengthened. They no longer dragged “perfumed pallors and
				other mawkishness. They were no longer languid but heavy with lived images,
				reflecting the cruelty of an existence undergone at first not withous revolt, then
				with resignation and grandeur.</p>
			<lg>
				<l>My verses have not attained calm excellence,</l>
				<l>I have understood it, and no one will read them ever...</l>
				<l>There remain to me the moon and near silence,</l>
				<l>And the lilies, and especially the woman that I loved...</l>
			</lg>
			<lg>
				<l>My hands keep the odor of beautiful hair</l>
				<l>Let them bury me with my souvenirs, as</l>
				<l>They buried with queens, their jewels...</l>
				<l>I shall carry there my joy and my worry...</l>
			</lg>
			<lg>
				<l>Isis, I have prepared the funeral barque</l>
				<l>Which they have filled with flowers spices and nard,</l>
				<l>And whose sail floats in folds of shrouds</l>
				<l>The ritual rowers are ready... It is growing late...</l>

			<p>Increasingly appreciated in numerous milieus, Renée consented to unite her admirers
				and friends around her, and we assisted at some very strange soirees where 1 found

				<persName key="Colette" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q218679">Colette</persName>, Moreno, the <persName key="Butler, Charles Ernest" ref="http://vocab.getty.edu/ulan/500021757">Ernest Charles,</persName> the Lesdrain and our old Professor, assiduous

				and rejuvenated-without our governess, who some time ago had been thanked for her
				diverse offices. At these reunions I was accompanied by an actress with golden eyes,
				brown hair and a difficult character, whose presence dissipated all suspicion for
				Renée’s friend—who did not appear at any of these fetes, but had herself informed on
				all that happened there.</p>
			<p>One evening when I found myself at Renée’s she announced to me that her friend, who
				had no more uneasiness about us, had a wish to meet me and would come to dine with
				us. 1 manifested the intention to flee, but Renée begged me to stay. Her friend
				would interpret my refusal badly. She arrived promptly, arrayed in an evening gown
				that she had ordered from Laferriere, a dress which I had to admire. Since this
				meeting would facilitate Renée’s life, I had no choice but to resign myself to
				it.</p>
			<p>While waiting to find myself face to face with my rival—she whom the Princess H.
				disrespectfully named ’the blunder"—I asked Renée why she evidently attached so much
				importance to questions of costume where it concerned her friend, while she accorded
				them so little when they concerned herself?</p>
			<p>I like better to leave that bore to others and to ornament only my dwelling, she had
				told me, adding, hate the fittings and have not enough personality to triumph over
				them. I did however wish to be party to it by ordering a dress at one of the great
				couturieres, and went, before the appointed time for the fitting, to wait in a
				corner of the big salon till someone came to announce my turn. Having taken along a
				good book to keep me company, 1 read it without paying attention to what was going
				on around me. But when the evening obliged me to lift my head toward the light that
				they had just lit, I closed my book and got ready to go. My saleswoman,
				panic-stricken, tried to stop me. I replied to her, too happy to have an excellent
				pretext, and despite her excuses, ’that a similar inadvertence arrived only to the
				most patient...to the best clients....</p>
			<p>Resolute, 1 got out the door, assuring her, with a smile, that I would never
				return....</p>
			<p>When that opulent person entered, her hand extended, I remarked how that blue robe
				covered with little islands cut into a cloth of silver, surrounded with diamonds,
				seemed to evoke the islands of the Aegean Sea-an allusion at which we all smiled
				differently. After the dinner, the Chinese butler brought Renée tea, which in place
				of drinking she threw with saucer, cup and spoon into the fireplace burning before
				us. Ithought in spite of myself of her prayer: “Who then will bring me the hemlock
				in his hands?</p>
			<p>Did she throw that cup because it contained or did not contain the hemlock? Or
				because she judged this remedy derisory of her pain?</p>
			<p>An instant interrupted by the violent nervousness of her gesture, we took up again a
				conversation on horses, whereon her friend and I had found a ground for under-
				standing. She explained to me that a neighbor had proposed to buy from her a grey
				dappled horse of a breed that her stable was the only one to possess and which would
				match so well with one which the buyer already owned. Ought she to accept? She was
				hesitating, for to <pb n="71" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue03/Issue3_images/issue3_073.jpg"/> sell one of her horses pained her as much as the
				offer flattered her. On this, the hour to withdraw having sounded, she offered to
				drive me back. With a glance, Renée prayed me to accept. We left then together
				through the Bois as far as my pavilion, where she wished to enter with me. 1 excused
				myself, making pretext of an unsupportable headache (a malady that I have never in
				my life felt). She could only leave with a look of reproach.</p>
			<p>Some time after that evening—in the course of which she had tried in vain to teach me
				to smoke—the lady sent me a little cigarette case in enamel filled with tiny
				cigarettes, under the cover of which she had had engraved: “Always to the extreme,
				is it not, Mademoiselle?" Since I had done nothing to encourage the sending of this
				unusable gift—unless it was to ironically admire her dress—I supposed her on the
				look-out for adventure. I learned very soon after that the neighbor who had offered
				to buy her horse had made the bet before several persons of which she who reported
				the wager to me said, “Not only to possess this horse, but the owner along with. I
				right away advised Renée of this who, after having made her own investigation, had
				to recognize that the neighbor in question had won her bet. As she showed herself
				more indignant than pained by this affair, I tried to reason with her:</p>
			<p>Look, Renée, have you the right to get indignant on this point?</p>
			<p>"It is as if I had consented to marry a horse-dealer and that after sacrificing
				myself to someone so vile, this horse-dealer dared to deceive me. I will not endure
				this injury."</p>
			<p>Uneasy at the excessive way in which she resented this adventure that I considered
				harmless, after several years of a rare fidelity on the part of her companion, I
				questioned our Professor, still devoted to Renée. He informed me that she had
				decided to break “with this banal and hypocritical life. She put this project into
				execution. First wrapping up her favorite knick-knack, a jade Buddha, she liquidated
				her bank account and took away all her money. In the train which took her to
				Marseilles, while looking for her ticket for the conductor, she let fall a packet of
				bank notes in front of the other travellers. Fearing to be followed and robbed, she
				let herself be “picked up by the secretary of her friend—a friend who shortly
				following sent me a card, where I read this single word: “Judas."</p>
			<p>After this debacle and this humiliation, I do not know to what excess Renée gave
				herself up, without so much as renouncing her plan of voyage. She escaped anew.
				having this time better combined her departure with some relatives who accompanied
				her on a world tour. After her first stop, I received in fact a word from her,
				informing me that she had taken to the open sea to reflect, far from all that she
				had loved, on the continuation that she would give to her “miserable existence.
				Wounded on all sides, she had already withdrawn her books from sale. Some carping
				critics had decided her.</p>
			<p>The aspersions, the gross attacks, through her imagination, motivated three of her
				most beautiful poems:</p>
			<p>On the Public Place,““The Pilory, and “Vanquished. In the face of such results, I
				could only blame exaggerated sensibility and susceptibility. But I deplored that, by
				my insensitivity in precipitating the separation from her friend, I had added the
				drop of fatal bitterness. I feared for her health, already so damaged and which
				could not tolerate the least shock or the least reproach. At the time of a visit to
				her house, probably just before her voyage toward the Orient, <persName key="Marcelle Tinayre" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3289600">Marcelle Tinayre</persName> saw
				her so:</p>
			<p>She entered like a phantom. Already very ill, she wished to see me again.... Her body
				more fragile than formerly revealed nothing of its contours under the very simple
				dress of black muslin. How she has changed, alas!</p>
			<p>Always I shall re-see her, shadow in the shadow, recounting not her life, but her
				soul. She was speaking of the other world.... And all of a sudden, she said, “When I
				am so sad, so alone, so ill, I think that I would like to die Catholic. It is the
				sole religion where there is poetry and beauty. She added, smiling, “But no priest
				would permit me to keep my little Buddhist idols....</p>
			<p>How all this contrasts with the artificial Renée whom Colette presents in Ces
				Plaisirs!</p>
			<p>Though feeling that her despair surpassed all human aid, I wished to leave my house
				at Neuilly in order to wait for her return in a new place, where no bad memories had
				collected. I had then searched and finally found a dwelling between courtyard and
				garden, on rue Jacob, where I became the vestal of a little Temple of Friendship. In
				order to escape the moving, I rejoined that actress whom I had let depart with
				relief. From my arrival at <placeName key="Saint Petersburg" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q656">Saint Petersburg</placeName>, Ilearned that I was replaced: first by
				an attache of the French embassy, then by a Russian colonel. When I took the train
				again for the long return, an old diplomatic friend who had put me current with my
				misfortune brought me Voltaire's Candide.</p>
			<p>Scarcely installed in my new dwelling, I learned that Renée was ill “of a malady
				traversed by agonizing crises and that she no longer wishes to see anyone. However,
				that same evening I went to ask news of her, a bouquet of violets in my hand.
				Half-opening the door, a butler that I had never seen replied: "Mademoiselle just
				died. This announcement was made in the tone of "Mademoiselle just went out." I had
				not the presence of mind to insist that someone put these violets near her. Then,
				staggering, I regained the Avenue du Bois and fainted on one of its first
				benches.</p>
			<p>When I regained consciousness, I returned home and shut myself in my bedroom. Neither
				able nor wishing to see her dead, it was necessary at once to make contact again
				with all of her that remained to me. Like a grave robber, I took hold of the
				precious little box that she had given me. Its key lost, I had to open it by force.
				It contained so many tangible souvenirs that I felt her presence wander around me.
				They could then no longer prevent me from rejoining her. That this haunting not
				abandon me! For if 1 were no longer haunted, what would remain for me?
				Forgetfulness. But what lover, what poet, would wish it?</p>
			<p>I replunged into all her relics: the manuscript of the poems written for me,
				accepting life—a vacillating life—through my tears....</p>
			<p>The day after the next, I followed her internment like a somnabulist for it was not
				in this tomb that I could search for her, but well elsewhere and within myself.</p>
