				<p> We are a collective of lesbian artists working on a lesbian issue of <orgName key="Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17022558">Heresies: A
					Feminist Pub- lication on Art &amp; Politics.</orgName> We are soliciting material of all
					kinds, but in particular we are asking for responses to this question: What does
					being a lesbian artist mean to you? (Your work, your medium, your relationships
					to other artists, to the Art World, to the Lesbian community, etc.)</p>
				<p>You can approach the question verbally and/or visually, in any way that seems
					most applicable to you. In the issue we will print the question along with the
					replies. If you have any spec- ific feelings, pro or con, about signing your
					name, please include them in your response.</p>
				<p>Our copy deadline is April 15. Please send all material to: HERESIES, Box 766,
					Canal Street Station, New York, N.Y. 10013. C/O 3rd Issue.</p>
				<p>We will be selecting the material for the issue and contacting you in the spring.
					If YOU consider yourself to be a lesbian artist, please respond. And thank you.

				<p> Lesbian energy is the subject of my art.</p>
				<p>I weave useful objects, bags, ponchos, saddle blankets, and more. These objects
					are strong and durable, for I weave them with active lesbians in mind as
					customers. I want to make the best for lesbians. It is this attitude which makes
					my work "lesbian art."</p>
				<p>In the physical realm, there is little to set my work apart from another’s
					weaving; it could be copied exactly. But my feelings and thoughts, as I work,
					also become part of my product, just as surely as the design and color and
					threads themselves. This non-physical aspect is like the lint between the
					fibers, inseparable from the final product and, hopefully, seen and felt by the
					viewer, user, and/or wearer. It is the part which cannot be copied.</p>
				<p>Obviously, this is a hard proposition to prove, but I know from experience that
					it is true. Because 1, as a lesbian-separatist, am thinking strong, positive
					feelings about lesbians and lesbianism as 1 work, lesbians are drawn to my work.
					One told me she physically felt warm glows pass through her body when she put on
					a poncho; some have told me they feel strong with it. One woman referred to
					stripes in the shoulders of a poncho as “power stripes."</p>
				<p>Also, as a lesbian-separatist, I sometimes am thinking negative thoughts and
					feelings about men and some straight women as 1 work, and, consequently, they
					often do not even notice my display. There is no magnetic energy to attract
					them. Not only are they not attracted, but sometimes they feel repelled by my
					work. This pleases me, because I feel very strongly that I only want to sell to
					lesbians, and this way I don’t have to make any special effort to accomplish
					it.</p>
				<p>My partner is a jeweler, and she has noticed the same phenomenon. Many lesbians
					have told her that they draw strength and self-esteem from her work, not only
					from the lesbian symbol rings and pendants, but also from stone rings that are
					not specifically “lesbian." It is the love for herself as a lesbian, and her
					concern for all lesbians, which they are absorbing.</p>
				<p>Any subject, then, may be lesbian art, and lesbian subjects may not be lesbian
					art. What makes the difference, in my mind, is the thought and feeling about
					lesbians which the maker feels as she works, the tangible energy which becomes
					part of the product and is communicated to the consumer.</p>

				<p> Lesbianartist.</p>
				<p>I wish I had a lesbianartist button. Asmall black and white button with six-point
					Optima letters.</p>
				<p>Intimate. Women would have to read it up close. A button for a high-energy
					day.</p>
				<p>Clearly the word makes me happy.</p>
				<p>It didn’t always.</p>
				<p>I spent a lot of time not believing there was a connec- tion between my sexuality
					and the art 1 made, not believing my two carefully separated adult identities
					had been closely bound together even in childhood and, certainly not believing
					the content of my painting was emotional.</p>
				<p>Joining together two powerful words made me recognize the focus of my life and
					put me in touch with my own work.</p>
				<p>If I hadn’t been a lesbian I wouldn’t be an artist. From girlhood I had admired
					strong women, loving their intelligence and strength.</p>
				<p>I focused on what was woman-identified, experiencing a passion, not yet genital,
					not yet verbalized, that made me want to find an identity in work, in
					expression, in making paintings.</p>
				<p>In making art, I hadn’t before realized how closely related the content was to
					the impulse that made me want to be an artist in the first place.</p>
				<p>When I was eight years old I had a game.</p>
				<p>I would go out into a grove of trees away from the other children and would take
					pieces of bark and sticks. I would draw on them with nail polish and lipstick
					and crayons, writing secret things about admiration for women, about a crush on
					a woman.</p>
				<p>While making these I was very intent; but then I would get very frightened.</p>
				<p>The slightest sound of anyone approaching would make me hide them under leaves,
					bury them in the ground.</p>
				<p>In my work now 1 use wood and paint.</p>
				<p>I make marks that spell out secrets, burying them under layers and layers of
					glossy color.</p>
				<p>The secrets, repeated dozens of times, asserted and recognized, then protected
					and hidden so well—sometimes I don’t see them myself.</p>
				<p>It’s been a long time since I was eight years old, but the secrets, the pain and
					happiness of loving women were then and still are the motivation and content of
					my work.</p>

				<p>Some thoughts and answers:</p>
				<p>Did you know that I am not really an actual artist? When I was in first grade I
					found out that I could not draw and I knew it then. I don’t remember the exact
					moment of realization.</p>
				<p>I remember that for a long time, as a little girl, my fantasy was that I would
					marry a struggling artist and definitely never be one. I have been feeling a
					connection between deciding to be a lesbian and taking control of that fantasy
					and throwing it out the window for good. If 1 am never going to marry someone,
					or have a man be the “core of my existence, that fantasy can never become true.
					The struggling part of the fantasy is certainly out of my upper middle class
					background, where I idealized and romanticized struggling, and it is also part
					of the artist myth. Chronologically I decided to become an artist before I
					decided to become a lesbian, but they are and were part of the same process; of
					saying that my life is important, of valuing my life and my self as a woman, of
					beginning to let go of living for others and seeing myself in the eyes of others
					and also giving up that deeply ingrained and conditioned woman’s sense that only
					when 1 am giving, am 1 worth- while, do I deserve to live etc.</p>
				<p>At the time that I decided that I wasn’t an artist, I really decided it. I knew
					then that creativity and all that went with it was not part of me or my life.
					There was a stopping of the expression of my self, of the creating from inside
					of me, saying who I was and what the world was to me.</p>
				<p>I remember when I was pretty young, in Sunday school, doing a drawing of the
					Tower of Babel, which was hung up with other drawings and my teacher said that I
					was a good artist. She said it on my Sunday school report card. That is the only
					memory I have of being appreciated for art work. The next thing I remember is
					being in first grade and having our teacher put on music and we were supposed to
					draw to the music with our eyes closed. Everyone else in the class drew abstract
					drawings, apparently to the feeling and rhythm of the music. I drew a house, a
					tree and a walk. I did not get a star for my drawing and I think I was—I must
					have been—very embarrassed. 1 remember in third grade all of us making towels
					where we stitched threads into the towels and I was the only one who did not
					make a geometric design. I did some seagulls and an ocean with a boat on it.</p>
				<p>I knew that an artist was the one thing I would never be! There was something
					about my absolute non-identification with the creativity or activity of "artist"
					which had significance beyond the fact that I wasn’t calling myself an
					artist.</p>
				<p>I am seeing that being a lesbian means valuing my perceptions, as well as other
					women’s perceptions and seeing that the world is a place 1 (we) have a right to
					be in charge of. I realize my outsideness and with that knowledge I begin to
					learn and then create beyond the given reality, and live beyond it.</p>
				<p>There is a kind of question that is thought-provoking and "interesting" that I
					feel very involved in thinking about and asking. It has to do with some
					awarenesses that I have come to through being alive, particularly in the past
					few years. These questions stay with me and l love them and they feel like my
					“art. They are the results of awakening parts of me that have been shut down,
					not allowed to grow. I catch a glimmer of the me that really exists, fully
					alive, spontaneous, responsible, creative, awake and aware and active and
					unafraid. The feeling of a "first time” or a "new discovery” has to do with
					breaking through from that old space of hurt and shut down to the way 1 can be,
					the way every person can be, all the time.</p>
				<p>There is something very important to me about saying that I am a lesbian, that I
					am a feminist, that I am an artist, that 1 am a Jew, that 1 am a woman, that 1
					am from an upper middle class family, that I am white, etc. It has to do with
					owning parts of me, with feeling them, with being public, with all of me out,
					not ashamed of anything that 1 am. In that way it feels very active to say I
					am.</p>

				<p> Being and growing up lesbian always put me out of sync with my peers. I never
					did understand certain phenomena of our times. Do you remember screaming at your
					first Elvis Presley movie? Mine was Love Me Tender. I saw a whole generation of
					women screaming at the images and evocations of male sexual provocation. I sat
					in the audience wondering what it was that these women were feeling. I didn’t
					feel like screaming. I thought it was strange the way my friends were behaving,
					but always I felt the undercurrent that I was the one that was wrong.</p>
				<p>We have been brought up to respond to certain culturally defined stimulations. I
					didn’t respond. I went through school unaffected by the captain of the football,
					basketball, soccer, wrestling, and chess teams. Without these things there was
					little else. My friendships with women were steady but painful, when one by one
					they had their first crush with the new boy in town. They moved, talked and
					pleased one huge romantic ideal-- falling in love and marriage. Sex was already
					there; their tease and their rape. Living in rural Lake Hopat- cong, New Jersey,
					didn’t provide any alternative lifestyle, not in the fifties.</p>
				<p>When I came out as a lesbian it was wonderful. A whole life began to take shape.
					Coming out was a joyous time. Suddenly ice blood dissolved, walls became windows
					and doors. But making a new lifestyle is a slow and steady process. It took
					years to wear away at the circles of isolation, fear and repression. I wanted
					the knowledge I felt had been hidden from me. The gay and women’s movements
					provided support and information. With a growing perspective, doing my art work
					became really important and possible. Now there is so much I feel I want to do.
					Part of that is I want to leave records. Growing into womanhood 1 am finding my
					ancestors and making herstory. Our contact creates fibers and pathways for
					others.</p>

				<p> In the deepest sense of the word, 1 see lesbian humor as the essence of the
					playful spirit, but play in the most challenging-to-the-cosmos sense. We play
					with our imagination, with our sexual freedoms, with our clothes -costuming not
					to represent power parodies like leather, but to laugh at the confines of color
					and texture, lines—and in our playing we create new worlds because of the
					deepest sense of the deadliness of this one. Les Guerilleres is playing at its
					most powerful, creation of language, names, structures, with joyous energy and
					warrior strength. I know this sounds philosophical, and yet even when 1 was an
					old femme 1 knew there was an amazon world—not by reading or talking but by the
					strength and adventure I felt in entering the bars, walking the street late at
					night, stepping out of bounds even if it was to find a closeness that was
					defined by who did what. The important thing was we did, and we laughed in the
					faces of the Mafia men. Our play with language seems to come from the same
					impulse—to turn around the givens, to reinforce each other’s daring and strength
					in playing above this world. I think our humor, like many other parts of our
					culture, is celebration—the cheering on of each other to make a new universe in
					the presence of each other, to drop the sticks of this world at each other’s
					feet and pick up the pieces all mixed up and in so doing assert our ability to
					create new worlds. I think our writers have mostly known this: they played with
					sentence structure and threw their words up into the air, their air, to make
					them fall into a different way of symbolizing a different life. I think we play
					because this world is not ours, and we are self-cherishing enough to know we
					must live somewhere. We are connected to each other enough to believe we have
					the power to create new worlds at this very moment with the words we play
					with.</p>

				<p> Lesbian is who I am; feminist is how I think. Femin- ism gave me vision,
					self-love, and love for other women, not the other way around. 1 know women who
					love women and are not lesbians. I know lesbians who are haters of self and
					other women (no surprise: men hate us and fuck us). Nevertheless, for me coming
					out as a lesbian was continuous with my development as a feminist. I can’t talk
					about myself as "lesbian artist apart from "feminist artist"; nor do I want
					to.</p>
				<p>The year I came out was the year in which I began writing again, after a nine
					year silence. I now understand that breakthrough partly as an explosion through
					fear—fear that inside me was a self, a vision, that would either horrify men or
					bore them. My friend Paula King says, "Being a lesbian meant 1 could create what
					wanted." Yes. It meant I stopped caring about male boredom, shock, or disgust.
					It meant—and means—that women are at the center of my eye, that I think of
					women’s ears when 1 write, that my work grows through the tug and shove of
					female response to it.</p>
				<p>But it was not just coming out which allowed me to write. It was also the
					conscious creation/discovery of a tradition of female art, a sense of connection
					with other creators, past and present, a connection which provides support,
					validation of one’s technique and subject matter, and a source for imagery,
					ideas, and forms. This is a circulatory system which makes me know we are one
					body; the network is literally vital.</p>
				<p>A friend tells me she read Lessing's <title>Golden Notebook</title> in the early
					sixties and found it “boring," i.e., threatening; the air of that time clogged
					her ears with self-hate. When I read the same book in 1970, I was electrified.
					From my journal, 1970, after reading the GN: “With Anna pouring jug after jug of
					warm water over her stale-smelling menstruating cunt, you'd think she'd tell us
					what kind of birth control she uses. Does she never worry about being pregnant?”
					Never mind the body- hating words I chose in 1970. Lessing's matter-of-fact
					treatment of menstruation instantly upped my expectations so that I was annoyed
					by her omission of another facet of my bodily experience. Prior to the GN, prior
					to the feminist movement, it had never occurred to me to miss myself in all
					those books I plowed through. We are seeing in this last decade a gathering of
					demands on artists to tell the truth about female experience. We write in a
					context of an audience which requires responsible work from its artists, an
					audience responsive in turn to our subject matter and technique.</p>
				<p>I want to tell the truth as best I can, to recycle the energy 1 have gotten from
					women’s creative work, to get that energy back in the form of more and more
					women articulating their experience. We all have stories and they should be
					told—mine among them. Thus we come to understand our experience through naming
					it. Thus we nourish each other, feed our visionary selves--the selves who know
					change is possible. My medium is words. It is what I know. I feel its limits. I
					would rather make movies. I would rather take over TV. I would most rather
					overthrow the government. But words are what 1 can use.</p>
				<p>Much of my writing falls into the category “lesbian art" because 1 am a lesbian;
					the content is my experience, much of it common to all women. Fear of rape, job
					discrimination, survival anxiety, female solidarity, the whole societal weight
					of sexism, some struggles with men, participation in raising two boy children,
					watching them start to swagger, wondering how to love them as they turn into
					little piggies. My past is heterosexual, different from that of lesbians who
					have always been aware of their love for women, who were never touched or
					wounded deeply by men. 1 want to explore, and want other lesbians to explore,
					these differences among us. Gay chauvinism: I have practiced it, been victimized
					by it. Now I see it as only destructive, as one more hierarchy (how long have
					you been out? 1 came out in the crib....)</p>
				<p>Since I began writing as a lesbian, much of my past remains unwritten: what has
					happened to women, how my life was formed, how it served men, how it did not
					serve me, how it was made to seem inevitable. What transpired in my marriage
					bed, for example, was predictable, anything but natural. It had as little to do
					with love or pleasure or sexuality as the grocery list. It had more to do with
					the grocery list.</p>
				<p>Also important in my past: familial relationships among women, my grandmothers,
					mother, aunts. need to see these more clearly, with less anger, less fear of
					being trapped as they were trapped, with more love. I have not yet written about
					the deep bond between myself and my sister, a positive model for the
					relationships I build with women.</p>
				<p>I assume the telling of my specifically lesbian experiences is useful since I
					find myself so hungry for details of other lesbians' relationships. We all need
					practice in seeing what is happening and in telling the truth. In how to love
					each other better than we were taught. How it is hard to face a formless,
					unfolding future. We used to chant these words like a litany, double axes
					gleaming in our eyes. Now I am more aware of difficulties alongside the palpable
					joy. I want to be honest about these difficulties.</p>
				<p>Yet I find myself hopeful. If sexuality is one of the earliest deepest emotional
					constructs to be institutionalized in our tiny child-bodies, and if at age
					twenty-six I could discover a range of sexual feelings—a whole capacity
					previously invisible—I can only conclude that all change is possible, and that
					we don’t yet know a fraction of our capabilities. So I feel great optimism about
					personal transformation within severe limits. I feel less optimistic just at
					present about breaking through the limits, i.e., transforming the world. I feel
					despair/comfort when I think how my opportunity for growth is stifled by
					patriarchy/capitalism—despair because I will never get to be my fullest possible
					self; comfort because 1 can at least understand the reasons for my blocks,
					fears, tightness. I see danger in demanding that we live the revolution before
					the revolution. The relationship between consciousness, action, and material
					reality is crucial. I have been working on some notes—still formless—about
					competitive feelings among women; not competition for men, but feelings of envy
					and threat among lovers and friends. I see these feelings partly as a realistic
					response to a world whose goods need not be scarce, but are (jobs, publishers,
					even love and respect): partly as an archaic response to an old and perilous
					lesson about competition. I have felt much guilt about my feelings of
					competitiveness, a guilt which keeps me from feeling them, thus from working
					through them. I want to write about the masking feelings- feelings we feel
					instead of feeling something else: guilt; embarrassment; boredom; laziness; even
					desire. I want to rename my feelings more accurately, to disrupt the <pb n="46"/> categories within which I learned to know myself. To recognize the weight of
					the past so 1 can more readily put down what is burdensome, hug what is useful.
					To acknowledge my luck in living through a time when the feminist movement is
					making my life joyful and my work possible; to acknowledge my dependence on our
					movement's continued movement.</p>
				<p>Finally, I want to learn not to say what comes easiest, since for me “easy” often
					means old." This last comes from my experience of being challenged by my lover,
					another poet, about the ending of a poem: “Do you really feel as helpless as
					that?” she asked, and I had to confess that I didn’t, and I rewrote the poem.
					Here is the rewritten poem. It is the most logical conclusion.</p>

				<p> I am writing as a lesbian feminist artist in the Minnesota Arts Community. This
					is difficult because there are few substantial conversations about the personal
					and political implications of lesbian art here, and those few conversations that
					do exist result from an atmosphere of paranoia.</p>
				<p>There are two specific instances of the art world in the Twin Cities politically
					using the label “lesbian” to exert community control over women’s groups. The
					first was the termination after one year of the Women’s Arts Core Program at the
					College of St. Catherine in St. Paul. The program instilled great fear and was
					discussed and desscribed by those not participating as a lesbian program that
					used harmful brainwashing techniques. As a result the students in the program
					were questioned about lesbianism and in certain instances verbally pressured to
					give information concerning the number of lesbians in the program, who they
					were, and who they were sleep- ing with.</p>
				<p>The women in the program were asked to submit reports on their area of academic
					study, fill out program evaluations, and participate in hour long tape-recorded
					individual interviews. All of these demands were met and the participating women
					themselves felt the program was highly successful. However, the paranoia,
					hostility and inherent homophobia induced a full faculty meeting to vote for a
					moratorium until further studies could be completed. That was five months
					ago.</p>
				<p>The political use of the lesbian label to attack feminists and their art worked
					once and it may work again. Similar tactics of divide and conquer are being
					aimed at the W.A.R.M. Gallery, a women’s co-operative art gal- lery in
					Minneapolis. Because it is a women’s gallery with an all-woman membership and
					exhibition policy, the community has labeled it as a lesbian organization,
					although in reality the gallery includes and shows both straight and gay women.
					Sexual preference has not been a criterion. However, outside homophobia is
					manipulating internal homophobia, by using “lesbian” as a negative and dangerous
					image. Gallery members have been told that people are afraid to come into the
					gallery because they would be confronted by radical lesbians and that W.A.R.M.
					has a dyke image.</p>
				<p>In reaction to this some of the women in the gallery feel compelled to exhibit
					male artists and have submitted exhibition proposals which read like this:
					Invitational for Men—Each gallery member would choose one male artist who they
					feel has been supportive of women to be included in the show. I feel this would
					be good P.R. for the gallery in the arts community and a good way to get
					publicity as well as being an encouragement for men to be supportive of <pb n="44"/> the women movement, etc. People like [name withheld] deserve a
					thank you from us all.</p>
				<p>"Let’s invite a man to have a show."</p>
				<p>Women feel comfortable in dealing with the lesbian issue without the protective
					environment of an all-woman organization but remain concerned about the external
					public image. In their attempt to dispel the les bian image, they want to
					integrate men in some way. The assumption is that male reads “heterosexual” and
					female reads “lesbian." This situation allows the established community
					structure to have a foothold on the internal workings of the feminist structure
					with women spending the majority of their time and energy taking care of the
					general community (men) rather than themselves and their work. Of course this is
					one purpose of patriarchal politics.</p>
				<p>If the above mentioned questions were changed from dispelling the lesbian image
					to dispelling the discriminatory practices that are associated with the label
					“lesbian, then the community would need to be directly confronted and held
					accountable for its own discriminatory practices whether based on sexual
					preference or bias toward all-woman structures.</p>
				<p>The politics surrounding homophobia is reminiscent of McCarthyism or the power
					which is generated from the manipulation of fear. Consciously/unconsciously
					choosing to be manipulated by internalized fear makes every individual a
					vulnerable target. Taking a passive or non-confronting posture allows the
					existing homophobic structure to remain intact. Political maneuvers of this kind
					have separated gay and straight women, working class and middle class women, and
					white and Third World women. It has driven wedges into the power base of
					woman-developed structures, separated us from our goals, and dispersed our
					creative energy.</p>

				<p>I found that the only real support that I got in Stockholm came not from the
					official women’s movement, "Group 8," but from the lesbian women of the
					“Victoriagroup." The reason for this is that the straight women's movement is
					too worried about gaining approval from the male left and is too afraid to be
					associated with lesbian feminism and so is not capable of developing a true
					women’s culture—which is what I am into.</p>
				<p>A real women’s culture can only be developed by women together, women who have
					withdrawn their sexual, creative, and emotional power from men. Women who
					ultimately seek male approval, because they are sexually dependent on men, will
					never ultimately be able to draw any real consequences of their own actions,
					feelings, and thoughts. They will always be somehow looking sideways. So the
					real out- rageous and unafraid statements have come from lesbian women. [I am
					very aware when I say this that at this point in time a great deal of women’s
					sexual dependence” on men is simply based on economics (women's poverty and fear
					of losing their children), and that the majority of women have no choice in the
					matter of whether or not to live with a man.]</p>
				<p>When I slowly managed to produce true (to myself) paintings of women, they seemed
					perfectly obvious and at the same time had a look about them of something not
					being quite right to many who saw them for the first time. So unused are we
					(women &amp; men) to seeing women portrayed with strength by a woman. My
					paintings were accused of being “ugly," meaning the women are not pleasing to
					men.</p>
				<p>It is when you as an artist portray women with love and pride—and not just
					complain about women's situation and repressed lives—that the abuse is thrown at
					you. Male critics, who actually call themselves left-wing and radical, have said
					about my work that “they feel alienated from my view on women and my views on
					sisterhood and motherhood." I am accused of being a mystic. Some of my paintings
					are based on what 1 have understood of matriarchal societies—where the religion
					was centered around the Great Mother and women were the main producers, the
					first farmers, and owned the land. One of my paintings shows symbolically the
					universal creative power as a woman giving birth in space (God Giving Birth").
					But that is only one of my paintings; others are of women working, struggling,
					relating to each other. According to the Swedish critics I should keep only to
					the kitchen sink or talk about my pain at being born a woman in a man’s world.
					Apparently you shouldn’t presume as a woman that you should or could make any
					flights into thoughts about creative energy, religious beliefs, the cosmos, or
					women’s identity in relation to herself and other women.</p>

				<p> For some time 1 have recognized that my sculpture reflects aspects of my
					personal experience. Nevertheless I had not been able to effectively distinguish
					the personal lesbian content of the work from the broader female imagery.
					Recently, however, I realized I had been inter preting the work in terms of
					female anatomy and genitalia, but not in terms of how I experience those forms.
					The unity, strength and openness, the materials and the arrangement of forms
					that I see in my work closely connect with the expansion of self into nature
					which I feel during orgasmic contact with a woman. The biological parts of my
					work are common to all women; the sexual experience, as a whole, is lesbian. I
					would like to share two of my sculpted images which express the spiritual/
					sexual nature of that experience.</p>
				<p>"Omphale" is a large, open bowl that is a visual expression of the orgasmic
					experience. The vessel has always been a symbol of change, from simple cooking
					conversion to alchemical transformation. The activity of “Omphale” creates
					feelings of change from moving into, through, and out into the landscape. To
					indicate the transformation the image is carved from "fungal elm wood striated
					with earth-like patterns of decay. The dilated protuberances curving around the
					bowl are felt sequentially in the act of swelling. The swollen forms actually
					radiate out into the landscape while the wide spout of the bowl tips toward the
					earth. </p>
				<p> The biological forms in “Autoerotic Bowl" are simply five fingers poised at the
					vaginal opening. The bowl knot which still retains the natural rough bark is
					made of oak. From the exterior body of the bowl’s surface the fingers curve
					inwardly around the lip. The movement from the erotic act itself to the natural
					landscape is obvious: the bottomless bowl opens into the earth.</p>
				<p>Embodied in the work is a sense of the personal, historic and mythic. My readings
					on mythologies and ancient cultures clearly have expanded my understanding of my
					imagery. 1 am intrigued by the resemblance of Autoerotic Bowl" to the basic
					structure of the rhyton, which was a ceremonial vessel with holes in both ends,
					used in Minoan culture. It is significant that the libation liquid to effect
					change had to pass through the vessel/female symbol and then onto object or
					earth. With some sculpted pieces 1 make direct connections to the past by naming
					them after women in history. Omphale" was the name of a Lydian Amazon queen.
					Moreover, in Greek the word "omphalos" means the center, middle or more
					beautifully that part of the rose where the seed forms are created. As in early
					civilizations and current primitive cultures, 1 feel that sculpted images should
					be used in ceremony.</p>

				<p> "Lesbian writers can’t be taken seriously. They’re limited. Narrow, kinky,
					twisted. Incapable of universality. Lesbian writing is not, certainly, for the
					mass market, for decent people’s homes. Let them have their little presses,
					their little distributorship and galleries. They make up a special interest
					group, like your bird watchers, your genealogists. So the male-identified
					critics say.</p>
				<p>My great-grandfather refused to allow my great- grandmother to buy paper, for
					fear she would “waste her time writing. Confined to do stitchery, she
					embroidered lines of her poetry on the inner hems of her daughter’s dresses. She
					was a lesbian writer, though she would not have called herself either lesbian or
					writer. We lesbian writers are formidable, threatening, to the breastless
					controllers of power and money. They, too, are formidable. This struggle informs
					and enriches our art, and will not lie silent, will not be locked away. Lesbian
					writers have married men and kept house and borne children and cooked and
					cleaned their lives away scribbling in journals, writing letters to each other,
					shaping poems they kept hidden under mattresses or in sewing baskets. Lesbian
					writers have painted plates, arranged flowers, decorated birthday cakes and
					committed suicide. I know my kind, how it has been for us, and how long.</p>
				<p>As a lesbian writer, 1 report how it has been, what our options were, and what we
					chose. 1 tell our stories, the grimness and the love. I tell breast, hair,
					blood, the undulant curve and the clitoral vibration. I tell the touch and the
					womantalk which flows between us. I am speaking quietly, as calmly as l once
					spoke in recipes, of the power of the mother-will and of revolution.</p>
				<p>I have learned, in my confinement, skills which serve me well. I write as
					steadily as I once ironed men’s shirts, write as vigilantly as I watched over my
					toddlers and listened for their coughs in the night. I write as only women can,
					as only women have: with interruptions, and with love and without cease. My
					images are female, my symbols are female, my energy is female. Lesbian.</p>

				<p>All the dangers of being a woman under patriarchy intensify as my visibility in
					the dominant culture increases, especially since it increases by more than one
					count: as writer, feminist, lesbian, foreigner. Some of the dangers:
					trivialization, stereotyping (since much of my work is sensual and lyric I dread
					the possibility of being dubbed “erotic" and being limited to that label),
					isolation through the star-systems and image-making verbal and physical
					harassment, assault, threats. And co-optation. Of all these the fear of
					co-optation, of losing touch with myself, my sisters, what is necessary and real
					for us, this fear has never left me since I received. the Yale (Younger Poets)
					Award.</p>
				<p>Then again, visibility makes possible much greater contact with women. What
					enabled me to begin writing with authenticity was my decision, in 1973, to speak
					only to a female and feminist audience. It gave me a sense of community, a sense
					of connection and responsibility, a necessity beyond the personal pleasure of
					writing. It gave me stamina and sustained me. I no longer had to explain so I
					began to sing. This is a gift women have given me, a gift 1 want to share with
					as many as possible. And so I am grateful for the award, the visibility, which
					widens the circles of women I can get to know.</p>
				<p>Visibility also gives me permission to speak in public, or gives me certain kinds
					of authority, such as judging competitions. l’m still trying to come to terms
					with this, since 1 fear that it is through this door that co-optation most
					easily enters, but right now feel that if I can maintain my connection and
					responsibility to my women's community I can use these occasions to say or
					demonstrate things that the patriarchy would rather keep unmentioned.</p>
				<p>On the most immediate level, in my work, I am trying to write poems that are free
					of the institutionalized conflicts and brutality that have characterized our
					literary tradition for so long, to use simple grammar and syntax, and to praise,
					praise.</p>

				<p>Before talking about what it means to me to be a lesbian artist, 1 want to
					emphasize two other distinguishing things about myself: (1) I am a West Coast
					person, having lived in San Francisco for the last fifteen years (though I grew
					up in the Midwest). We live differently out here from people on the East Coast
					or in the middle of the country. We are in a different relation to our lives,
					our bodies, our work and “careers. (2) I am not attached to any academic
					institution, nor have 1 ever been since 1 was a student.</p>
				<p>The term artist is hard for me to use, given its connotations of privilege,
					elitism and irresponsibility. The mystique surrounding that term is damaging to
					us as women, I think, and as makers of things. Maybe l’II just call myself a
					writer, for the purposes of this discussion. Now: being a lesbian writer. I
					think of myself as an outlaw. I operate outside the heterosexist establishment,
					and my effort is to subvert it so that some more humane system can be
					established. Women are primary to me.</p>
				<p>Having worked for a year in New York as a guest editor at Mademoiselle and having
					for years followed with passionate interest the goings-on in the so-called
					literary world, I think I know what it’s about. (I speak of the world of the New
					York Review of Books and its little brothers.) And the conclusion I have come to
					is that this world subsists on and purveys a very high level of bullshit which
					is, at worst, destructive to women, and at best, a waste of time for us.</p>
				<p>I feel myself to be part of a world of print created by the independent women’s
					newspapers, journals and publishers such as the Women’s Press Collective,
					Daughters, Inc., Diana Press, etc. All of us together are creating something
					new, in that we are bringing into literature a consciousness that has never been
					expressed before.</p>
				<p>The task for me is to get to what I know and then express it in the clearest way
					possible (I do not mean to say that one function precedes the other; they are at
					best simultaneous.). When I say that I want my writing to be accessible to
					everyone, I do not mean that I wish to write conventional novels in the style of
					the nineteenth century, which is still the formula for pulp fiction. But I am
					concerned with content, as I think all genuine feminist writers are. We want to
					examine the experience of women and articulate the hard questions posed by the
					struggle of the last few years. And for me, <pb n="48"/> prose is not
					performance, but ideally a clear glass through which the reader enters the
					story. The medium should disappear.</p>
				<p>Part of the revolutionary content of our work, I believe, is the re-experiencing
					of our bodies. Having been brought up in a repressed and ignorant condition for
					the purposes of capitalism and heterosexism, our resistance to knowledge of our
					bodies is extreme. We are traumatized, we freeze, we become blind and deaf in
					the pres ence of flesh. A book that confronts us with flesh is Monique Wittig’s
					The Lesbian Body. And because we resist so strongly, Wittig has to proceed in a
					violent manner. She has to take us by the back of the head and shove our face
					into it to make us look at the body, touch, smell, taste it from the inside,
					make us stare at it rotten and putrid and every possible way it can be—so that
					we will come to know and accept and love our own flesh.</p>
				<p>Part of what I love about dykes is our toughness. And that toughness can be
					connected up with a deep awareness of women too; lesbians are mothers and
					lesbians are daughters, so we have the whole range of women’s experience and the
					other dimension too, which is the unique viewpoint of the dyke. This extra
					dimension puts us a step outside of so-called normal life and lets us see how
					gruesomely abnormal it is, lets us see the kinds of illusions that people live
					by, that steal people’s lives from them. It puts us up against the moment,
					against the reality of creating our own lives and relationships because there
					are few models. But this examining and inventing reaches out beyond our
					individual lives and relationships into a way of viewing what goes on around us,
					and can issue in a world-view that is distinct in history and uniquely
					liberating. It is our continued working together over time, taking risks,
					remaining true to ourselves and stretching ourselves out be yond our limits,
					that will lead us to the development of this world-view.</p>
				<p>What I want to do in my own work is to affirm wom- en’s strength, and I don’t
					mean by that to pretend to a kind of strength that isn’t real. (For instance, I
					find heroines like Wonder Woman or Super Dyke offensive.) In the novel l’ve been
					writing, the character who started out at the most disadvantage, supposedly, was
					one of the women who was very aware of her own anguish, who experienced herself
					in pain and out of joint with other people and the world. Over time, she is the
					character who developed the most strength. The other women in the book, who
					initially were more appealing, did not grow as much. It surprised me during the
					writing of the book, to see this woman, the most ineffectual and hurting one,
					develop into the most complete and effectual human being there. I didn’t intend
					for this to happen; she just grew naturally within the events and feelings and
					interactions of the novel. And looking back, I think her depth came from her
					being so connected to, so aware of, her pain. So when I present images of
					women’s strength, 1 want that to come out of a true understanding of the
					difficulties of our lives and the agonies one has to endure in the midst of our
					struggles and victories. To tell the truth is not easy. I hope I have the wisdom
					and courage and skill to do it.</p>

				<p> In my personal life the power of the combination lesbian/feminist/artist is
					tremendous. By personal life 1 mean the life I lead in my studio, where 1 take
					measure ments of myself and begin to invent hypotheses and possibilities based
					on these measurements. One way in which the power of lesbian/feminist/artist has
					manifested itself is in the terror that I uncover through painting. Sometimes I
					need a couple of hours to "recover” after a painting. I can feel very tangibly
					as though with a painting my head has split open and something has been birthed
					from that chasm. The terror is (again, tangibly) the feeling that my head needs
					to close up before I can interact with the world directly, lest something
					unwanted and terrible from the world get in through that split. I always have
					this feeling after painting something that comes from my gut, something that, no
					matter how indecipherable to anyone, has come from an automatic gesture from
					within me. 1 can recognize it as such.</p>
				<p>Two things I have learned from lesbian-feminism are that: a) irrational terrors
					are possibly not irrational at all but part of a terrorizing way of life that
					goes on for all women, and b) the terror often increases for women who take
					steps away from compliance with the system. Terror of rape, terror of being
					molested, of being tortured, of being taken over, of intrusion. I link all these
					together for myself and for other feminist lesbians. They are real. We’re not

				<p>Because of my saturation in sociology, I believe that all theories should be put
					to the test of research. In my opinion, the question of a common denominator
					existing between women artists, other than gender, is still on the drafting
					table, is still a theory unproven. Without defining it, it is dangerously
					refutable. Without defining women s art, it is impossible to secondly reach
					conclusions about lesbian art. As long as there remains essentially no data, as
					long as art remains what the individual concedes it to be, general terms such as
					lesbian art will always be uncomfortable terms lesbians believe to be true
					without knowing how to define what they mean. In other words, "I know l’m a
					lesbian artist but I don’t know what that means. Sure, 1 could come up with
					something, but I believe a political statement merits more research than what I,
					or several other lesbians, could individually come up with.</p>
				<p>As far as the Sweaty Palms show (in Chicago), where four of us advertised our
					work as being produced by four lesbian artists, 1 can only speak retrospectively
					and for myself. The show proved that one can not stereotype lesbians and the art
					they produce; one could not find any similarities even between the four of us.
					It also made myself, and probably others, start thinking about what lesbian art
					could be. 1 feel that in some respects Sweaty Palms posed a question. That
					question is still unanswered.</p>
