				<quote>"Women have often felt insane when cleaving to the truth of our experience.
					Our future depends on the sanity of each of us, and we have a profound stake,
					beyond the personal, in the project of describing our reality as candidly and
					fully as we can to each other." <persName><persName key="Adrienne Rich" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q270705">Adrienne Rich</persName></persName><note>âWomen
						and Honor: Some Notes on Lying," Rich, Adrienne. Heresies, Vol. 1, January,
						1977, p. 25.</note></quote>
				<p>The Tapes are the edited comments of ten lesbian visual artists who met as a
					group in New York City during the winter of 1977. Even though many of us had had
					prior experience in feminist and lesbian groups, none of us had ever before sat
					down to talk about our lesbianism and our art. For each of us, this new group
					experience was profoundly moving. Discovering after our first meeting that the
					experiences of the âolder" lesbian artists (age 30-45 years) seemed vastly
					different than those of the younger artists, we found it necessary to separate
					into two smaller groups. The Tapes represent, with the exception of the
					âComing Out" section, the thinking of the older group. At some time we hope the
					younger group, which continued to meet, will produce a similar statement.</p>
				<p>With our goal being to share our experiences as lesbian artists, we found
					ourselves discussing a myriad of issues, the highlights of which are presented
					here. A number of surprising facts emerged. Only two of us had identified as
					lesbians for more than four years. As would be expected, the experience of being
					a lesbian in the fifties and sixties had a strong impact on our politics and
					attitudes. The majority of the group had not experienced the quality of
					oppression, repression, rage, and despair that only the fifties could inspire.
					Four out of six of us in the older group are mothers and the subject of mother-
					hood became one of the most profound and painful issues to emerge. That the
					institution of motherhood for these women artists was a greater source of
					oppression than that of being identified as a lesbian and that their motherhood
					functioned initially as a survival mechanism were both striking revelations. A
					less surprising discussion included the complexity of relationships with our
					mothers, sources of great difficulty as well as inspiration. The section which
					mentions established women artists is short because of the probability of being
					taken to court for divulging some of our personal knowledge or sharing some
					well-worn secrets about those mighty ladies. The sections on anger, energy, and
					work should be further amplified by other lesbian artists. This is the area of
					The Tapes which I find most important to me as a painterâthe information which
					was kept a mystery to most of usâprobably to maintain certain myths about the
					process of making art. Although only fragments are presented here, at least it
					is a beginning for the sharing of "secrets.</p>
				<p>It was difficult for us to focus on the energizing effects of our lesbianism on
					our work. Obviously, this is the area which needs the most thought. Some of us
					sense that we have special powers and great potential to make the best art. Why
					is that? Coming out gave most of us a great deal of energy for our work. But
					what is it about being a lesbian that really affects our work directly and makes
					it different from other work, if it is different? What does lesbian art look
					like? This subject was only touched upon during our discussions. The fact that
					there is only a handful of us scattered here and there and even less who are
					exhibiting our work or who have a degree of visibility as artists and as
					lesbians seems to indicate the powerful male machinery and the myths which control an artist even in her studio. The anguish of working that is evidenced in
					this article is some indication of how much guilt we carry around with us for
					having done it at all. As a community, we seem to be in a comparable place to
					that of the feminist art community five years ago, yet with the double jeopardy
					of coming out as les bians as well as artists. Our need for community is overwhelming and yet, as The Tapes reveal, we have ambiv- alence even about that.
					Forming a community is almost impossible when ninety percent of its potential
					members choose to remain in the closet. I see The Tapes as a nudge toward a
					common ground for lesbian artists. At the very least, it will provide
					information about how some of us live and work and what we are thinking
					aboutâexamples of the fact of our existence</p>

				<head>COMING OUT</head>
				<p>"My mother found me in bed with a woman when I was sixteen. I was scared to
					death. She walked over to me and said, You are swineâ and slapped me as hard as
					she could. I raced out of the house and I was out in the night.... My mother
					never looked for me.... I disgusted myself, and yet, this relationship was my
					only happiness. With all the politics, that rejection is never diminished."</p>
				<p>"I am thirty-eight. I came out as a lesbian twenty-one years ago, in 1956. I came
					out publicly about five years ago, at a <orgName>Womenâs Ad Hoc Committee</orgName> meeting. There
					was no comment from anyone there. It was as if lâd sneezed. When 1 came out 1
					also made an important commitment to being an artist. The two seemed to go <pb n="16" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue03/Issue3_images/issue3_018.jpg"/> hand in hand in nourishing each other... My father stopped
					supporting me and for the first time I was forced to start thinking about how I
					was going to survive.</p>
				<p>"I didnât watch a movie, watch a TV program, have a conversation with a man for
					two years. I didnât read a critical art journal, nothing. Ideally, I would have
					liked to have lived that experience for ten years, intensely involved with
					another woman."</p>
				<p>"I felt a speedy and incredible rush of energy for awhile. However, I think an
					equal amount of energy, a different kind of energy, goes into just sustaining
					the center of myself around being a lesbian."</p>
				<p>"In coming out, I felt magical for the first time in my life, and I felt I could
					use that magic in my painting."</p>
				<p>"I am twenty-three. I came out about a year ago. When I was in art school a
					lesbian painter came to speak. I think the response she got made me realize
					there was no way a woman could have her experience, her art taken seriously (let
					alone come out as a lesbian) in that context. I dated one of my male
					professors, believing it to be a sure method of getting attention for myself as
					an artist.... lâve got to be a lesbian in order to be a painter because there is
					no other way in this world that I can make art that is my own. 1 feel that I do
					have a strong support group. Two lesbians/painters/friends live in my building.
					Weâve been to the same art school and listened to the same rhetoric. I donât
					want to talk like the boys do. 1 want my language to come directly from my work.
					We are having a very hard time with this (language) which may have to do with
					still not believing in ourselves."</p>

				<p> "I feel that I came out through the <orgName key="feminist movement" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15580856">Womenâs Movement</orgName>, with a certain support
					group around me which made it very easy; very, very, comfortable. That support
					group, combined with my work, was a place where 1 could deal with certain parts
					of myself, so I really confronted my lesbianism in my work and it was just a
					matter then of removing the hidden parts of it in my work, taking the layers
					away, admitting what was in the work. Once that was bared, it was obvious. I
					think that I found a real support group in being a lesbian. That was not a
					painful experience for me. But what 1 had not found was a support group as a
					lesbian artist. I am pretty fortunate. I am always hired as a visiting lesbian
					artist. I can be out pretty much wherever I go.</p>
				<p>"I came out within the past year. I think it is directly related to focusing on
					whether I could be a painter or not."</p>
				<p>"It seems very clear to me that I am different and it takes me a long time to
					remember that it's because I am a lesbian.... I feel that when I came out I went
					in. It's like everyone 1 know seems to come out. And 1 have been thinking lately
					about the people who donât. My relation- ships with them have been very
					different and not as important."</p>
				<p>"I am twenty-two. 1 came out at school last year. I know lâve been a lesbian for
					a long time but it was a matter of being afraid to admit it to myself. But I
					think I was smart enough along the way to cultivate friends who were supportive
					and sympathetic and shared a lot of my feelings and ideas so that by the time I
					was ready to come out publicly I had already surrounded myself with people who
					would support me.... 1 am a painter and one of the things that really concerns
					me now is bringing together my feelings about being a lesbian and my feelings
					about painting, because I feel as though they have been really separate. Now lâm
					trying to empty out a lot of the garbage from school. The rhetoric is sort of
					clattering in my head.... One of the big problems I have in painting is that I
					feel that my paintings arenât mine.1 have trouble doing them and I feel they
					donât come from me. For that reason I have a feeling I am always lying. Lying to
					myself and not taking myself or the work seriously."</p>

				<head>MOTHERHOOD</head>
				<p>"Ihave been denied my motherhood. I am not allowed to have my children, to have a
					say about where my children go to school or what's to become of them. I am permitted to see them on weekends. I am not permitted to take my children for two
					months in the summer....I was not allowed to have my children in my loft for two
					years because l am schizophrenic and because I went to a looney bin. And because
					I am considered by my society and by my husband not fit to be a mother. The
					children have made the bridge by coming to me and making other things
					possible.... I would not choose to have my children all year round because I
					want to paint. Butl would choose to have them for a month or six weeks in the
					summer and lam not permitted that."</p>
				<p>"My children are some of my closest friends. I am the only person here who has
					made the choice to throw my lot in with the kids. I have kept peace and havenât
					gone <pb n="17" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue03/Issue3_images/issue3_019.jpg"/> through the terrible struggles and pain which you all have.
					But on the other hand, I am thirty-eight years old and have no work which really
					moves me. Itâs going to take me a long time now to develop that, having made the
					choice I made. I have paid a big price for that choice."</p>
				<p>"I don't have children and my family doesnât think l'm a person because 1
					havenât. 1 had an abortion. It was a choice that lâm only beginning to forgive
					myself for now. Before that I thought abortion was murder. But when I got
					pregnant I didnât care. I would rather kill than to have men in my life. I
					couldnât have been a painter. Everything would have been destroyed."</p>
				<p>"I donât feel my lesbian oppression as greatly as I have felt oppression as a
					mother. That isolation is just so brutal that I had to get out of it. It was
					killing me. I donât feel that about being a lesbian."</p>
				<p>For me, having a child was the only way there could be a possible experience of
					direct physical love, because l could not feel any honest physical love with a
					male and physical love with a female was taboo. So that was my inspiration to
					have a child.... But then when I had the child I had nothing but hatred for it
					because it took me from the studio."</p>
				<p>"Having a child was the only way I knew to love myself. I loved being pregnant. I
					had incredible energy. I was creative.... I fell in love with my body. I was
					back in my studio very quickly. It didnât interfere with my work. I had a good
					marriage. But I really felt that I had to leave it. I felt that way before I
					came out.... When I came out it scared the shit out of me. At first I thought
					that no one liked me anymore, even my best friends. I stopped asking things of
					people. Then a year later I left my children. I got to the point where I found
					myself crying week after week after week and then I lived with them again and I
					think you cannot do that unless you have a lot of support. I have lost a lot of
					time and history is against me."</p>
				<p>"My major quilt paintings came out of my first pregnancy when l had the twins.
					I was tapping into their growth and I painted ten enormous quilts during that
					pregnancy."</p>
				<p>"There was no social understanding for a woman who became a mother to separate
					herself to become an artist. I think it is categorically impossible to do both.
					.. without help. I left a six-month-old baby. And I cried for three
					years."</p>

				<head>OUR MOTHERS</head>
				<p>"I come from a family which includes two women artists, my mother and my aunt,
					but neither of them presented me with a real alternative to becoming a secretary, a teacher, or a housewife because of their terrible and unfulfilled
					struggle to make art. My mother never stopped being a housewife, never was able
					to totally pursue her work, although she paints much of the time and is fairly
					sophisticated in her knowledge of art. She is serious but never has made a mark
					for herself. She will never stop being primarily my father's wife. My aunt was
					an alcoholic, had two nervous breakdowns and ended up killing herself at the age
					of fifty-nine, after spending thirty years studying painting, including a summer

					with <persName key="David Alfaro Siqueiros" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q315647">Siqueiros</persName> and a year at the <orgName key="Barnes Foundation" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q808462">Barnes Foundation</orgName>. She had fifteen or so

					one-woman shows and is in four major museum collections. She married a man who
					was a writer and an intellectual who hated her energy and her gift and spent all
					his waking hours beating her down. On her death bed she was worried that he
					woulo not be able to get along without her, despite the fact that he had watched
					her as she slowly killed herself and did nothing to help. Both of their concerns
					for their men overshadowed any real help they could give me."</p>
				<p>"My mother is totally into self-denial. She is a very creÂ¬ ative, positive woman.
					... She is "the great woman behind the man."</p>
				<p>"The death of my mother-in-law woke me up to a direct vision of the content of my
					anger and my need for a rite of passage.... I perceived her death as all her
					womanÂ¬ energy turned against her. I had the incredible feeling that I was going
					to die too if I didnât do something. My selves had gotten highly separated. I
					was feeling very unreal... and her death coincided with that."</p>
				<p>"My mother died this year. She kept worrying that I would be alone because I
					didnât have children. I never worried about that before... but those being her
					parting words, I was filled with worry."</p>
				<p>"<persName key="Agnes Martin" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q275610">Agnes Martin</persName> told me that she was not free to be a painter until her mother died
					and she told me I would be that way too. She said, T was on the <placeName key="Staten Island" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18432">Staten Island</placeName>
					ferry and I heard my mother call "Agnes and I knew that she had died and I was
					happy because I was free to paint <pb n="18" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue03/Issue3_images/issue3_020.jpg"/> and I could let go of caring
					about her. ...As you know, Agnes was alone and totally accepted the joy of her
					own aloneness. People have different needs."</p>
				<p>"I remember being downstairs in my basement studio in my parentâs house when 1
					was in college. I was painting a black painting. I went upstairs to have a cup
					of coffee and my mother came out of her studio and said, Tm working on a black
					paintinglâ She thought it was wonÂ¬ derful because it meant we were one and the
					same perÂ¬ son. That was a very frightening intrusion to me, yet there was
					something mystical about it."</p>
				<p>As a child and as a young woman, I was constantly seeking female supportâin terms
					of love, and especially as it related to my sense of selfness as an artist and a
					poet. Anytime I made a bid for female support the disÂ¬ cussion was always that I
					was too sloppy, if I would only comb my hair some man would find me attractive.
					When I would go to a female for support, had that woman ever reached out... but
					she didnât. She gave me a whole list of what I was doing wrong and why I wasn't
					making it in straight society. What I needed was to straighten out and be like
					other women. That support was the same I got from my mother and father."</p>

				<head>THE ART WORLD</head>

				<p>"When I think of how I can relate to well-known women artistsâ<persName key="Louise Nevelson" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7531">Louise Nevelson</persName> is

					someone who stuck with the fight. Although she made herself into some kind of
					witch/sibyl. She isolated herself by the costume. <persName key="Martha Graham" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q487604">Martha Graham</persName> did the same
					thing. You could not walk up to Louise or Martha and say, 'Hey, letâs go have a
					cup of coffee.'"</p>

				<p>"The New York political art world is decadent.... It's perverted to the point
					that no one in it can have a noble, honest, or true friendship.... I find the
					work of that community to be abysmally dull, boring, repetitive, incestuous, and
					I donât think anybody has had an idea since <persName key="Duchamp, Marcel" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/5043149068581165730007/">Duchamp</persName>.</p>
				<p>"Some women are a lot like <persName key="Garbo" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/3725159248044004870000/">Garbo</persName> cashing in on homoÂ¬ sexual and heterosexual
					males. She's the muse on the pedestal. These women make themselves goddesses.
					Men accept them and gradually their work is also perÂ¬ mitted. But the men define
					what kind of women they are going to accept and how they are going to accept
					them."</p>
				<p>"Inspiration never comes from fame. The male bureauÂ¬ cratic power system from
					which 1 receive my support absolutely is a star system, a bad translation of the
					movie system into the art world."</p>
				<p>"Two of our country's most famous and respected women artists have never
					expressed their lesbianism publicly. But it became quite clear to me that any
					woman who made it through to creative art had exÂ¬ pressed lesbianism because
					they had expressed the totalÂ¬ ly feminine position in the universe."</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>ENERGY (A DIALOGUE)</head>
				<p>"I have to take naps after I make two moves back and forth to the painting. I
					work very intensely for those moments and I sleep for an hour to prepare myself
					for more work."</p>
				<p>"When I have my psychic energies up to do a piece, that is when my full self is
					its healthiest. I am having a flowÂ¬ er. As a woman 1 have options that very few
					other people on this planet have: to bring forth flowers. "Energy is something
					Iâm constantly struggling with. It's very important for me to know the place it
					comes from."</p>
				<p>"It is sparked by love, in its divinest form. It comes from being in love and
					catching passion. The passion can come from another person. It can come from
					your mind."</p>
				<p>"Maybe my struggle is on a more basic levelâwhich is how to use the love that l
					have."</p>
				<p>"How to use it constructively. And not to have wrong loves. lâve spent my life
					having wrong loves. "Wrong loves are in my past now. Misusing energy is what
					gets in my way."</p>
				<p>"Thatâs my magilla. I am a <persName key="libertine" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q744443">libertine</persName>. I am a spendthrift with energy.I am
					profligate and I should be locked up. I sit on six sticks of dynamite just to
					sit on the dynamite. And then nothingâs done.... 1 am always shorting. collapse
					because before lâve ever gotten to anything, I have used all the energy. I have
					never learned how to use the space between the fuse and the time the dynamite
					goes off.... I spend a lot of time in bed recovering from energy attacks."</p>
				<p>"All my life I have been punished for my energy. Did they ever call you a strong,
					domineering female?"</p>

				<pb n="19" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue03/Issue3_images/issue3_021.jpg"/>
				<p> "No. But have you ever been told by somebody that you need more rest than anyone
					else? That youâre burning the candle at both ends? My father once told me that
					while lâm going I should stick a broom up my ass and sweep on my way."</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>WORK</head>
				<p>"The experience of working is a microcosm of my whole life...the way I coerce a
					shape into forming, the severÂ¬ ity of my discipline...and the enormous doubting.
					Now I am making paintings on paper that are about a way of birthing a shape.
					Originally the shapes were about exterior spaces. They are starting to be more
					about internal spaces. I start with nothing in my head, on the paper, and with
					no feeling of a history of previÂ¬ ous work. When I am in front of a painting I
					don't even know how to hold a pencil, I forget everything know...asifl was
					starting out at three years of age.... The way I suffer a form through, there
					are so many things I will not allow to happen...the way I won't allow them to
					happen in my life.... This is a source of a lot of power and a lot of problems
					in the work. I can't accept a painting as having any meaning until it has gone
					through changes and changes, until many thinge are lost and it looks very simple
					and it doesn't look at all like it has gone through what it has gone through.
					The painting becomes separate and doesnât feel as though I had made it. l've
					discovered lately that the lines in my painting sometimes read as if they were
					light and someÂ¬ times as an âedge, like the way light sometimes falls on a bird
					flying outside my window, one minute it is soaked with light, the next, the bird
					has moved out of the light and I can see its outline against the sky."</p>
				<p>"I use very specific, concrete imagery whenever I am intensely exploring
					something. And then I abstract until I can claim my image. As I understand it
					better, that's how I would describe my process. My life has gone through
					dramatic changes and my work just diaries them. The big breakthrough was when I
					did a whole environment on pain.... I realized then that I had finally claimed
					my pain. It freed me to celebrate, to do performance, to do ritual."</p>
				<p>"What you have to do to get yourself to paint, doing one stroke and going to bed
					for four hours...(is) that Jungian thing of exposing the underlevels. You've
					made a mask and become a spirit. And so you have to do things or you wonât come
					back. ..that old shaman thing ...you go to heal somebody and you catch their
					disease and may never come back. Itâs like that. You go beyond. You pay
					psychically in going to the underlayer of the personality structure and bringing
					up stuff that you donât know and donât know where itâs going. I never even dealt
					with birth nor would I want to because I tend to be a classical artist and my
					art is removed from my emotions. I am not an expressionist. Maybe that's what
					keeps me from going bananas."</p>
				<p>"My work is very secretive. There are a lot of cubby- holes and dark spaces that
					one could get caught where the light doesnât come in. And the light distorts
					what the thing is and only gives you a hint of what that form looks like."</p>
				<p>"The only time I am not angry is when I am painting. And I donât want to destroy
					that by putting politics all over it. So that the one place I am totally human,
					the only place where 1 am the best possible personâwhich is in my artâgets
					fucked up with hating my father, resenting my brother, and being angry at all
					males and straight women."</p>
				<p>"When lâm getting ready for a show lâm thinking about my paintings all the time,
					and every time I do something connected to the show I have difficulty being
					sexual. I donât have a sexual feeling in my body. I feel like lâm dying. One
					thing lâve learned in the last ten years is that if you arenât sexual with
					people they leave."</p>
				<p>"After a show, lâve left several parties in my honor, generally crying. I walk
					home and lock the door and if anybody is dumb enough to come and pound on the
					door and say Why arenât you coming to the party?, I scream 1 never want to see
					you again. It doesnât generÂ¬ ally endear me to them."</p>
				<p>"My work process is so painful to me that I always need reassurance from other
					women that it's OK, that it's legitimate."</p>
				<p>"I used to think my work was very related to a lot of things that were going on
					in contemporary painting and I used to think there were certain young painters
					who were very important. lâve been thinking more and more about the fact that
					with few exceptions they really don't have the kind of quality I thought they
					had. If weâre really going to do it, letâs go back to the great art of the past.
					We set our sights too low. As lesbians we have the potential for making great
					art. </p>

				<head>ANGER</head>
				<p>"We each carry around enormous rage. I think that the threat in my life has been
					that my rage would destroy me, and until very recently, that has been a real
					possiÂ¬ bility. We need to focus our rage so that it becomes usable energy."</p>
				<p>"It has been a lesbianâs role to be angry. I object to that as a pressure for my
					own identity."</p>
				<p>There are different moral degrees of anger. Thereâs the anger where I say I could
					really murder. And that's absolute, malicious sin. And I believe itâs sin to my
					advantage. Then there is anger because I have been done in until lâm forty-five
					and stopped from being able to be an artist because lâve had to go to bed for
					nine or ten months because lâve been hurt. And that is an anger that I
					self-indulgently allow myself to be plowed under with ...and itâs a question of
					character strength to overcome that. And then thereâs an anger of Dammit, lâm
					going to do it, which I think fuses the work and is a very healthy anger...in
					itself it can be a very useful and motivating force...or it can be very
					self-defeating and you can get in a very paranoid fixation that can destroy
					you."</p>

			<div>
				<head>POSITIVE EFFECTS OF OUR LESBIANISM ON OUR WORK</head>
				<p>"Before the Gay Liberation Movement I felt like a maniac, not able to accept the
					reality of my queerness. I couldnât direct my full energy to my work."</p>
				<p>"(Being a lesbian) allows my womanness to be all mine. I have all that force
					behind my work. And thatâs what makes a difference.... The whole process of
					finding myself as a woman sexually and finding my course as an artist is a
					simultaneous process."</p>
				<p>"Thereâs that level of physical comfort, being able to relax, that's really
					important and it naturally affects my work."</p>
				<p>"Itâs that level of risk we encounter so much of the time ...it allows me the
					ability to take more risks in my work."</p>
				<p>"Ithink itâs good that men denied me a peer relationship. It made me stronger in
					my resolve that the art was important."</p>
				<p>"Tâve received the encouragement and the validation of my existence for things I
					have been vaguely, slowly moving toward all my life."</p>
				<p>"The more out front I become as a lesbian the more affirmation I receive from
					other lesbians and some straight women."</p>
				<p>"Tve been less terrified to make changes. ..so that I am now able to go into
					music or dance."</p>
				<p>"We donât relate to men much which makes it much easier for us to make art. I can
					be a primitive in my own time because of the fact that I am a lesbian. That
					gives me a lot of energy for my work, a lot of choice. My work can become more
					peculiar and its peculiarity is not threatening to me."</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>COMMUNITY</head>
				<p>"I feel very confused as to what my community is. There is no lesbian community
					of artists, no economic community.... I am certain that if it was a lesbian
					political gathering (instead of my show) there would have been a community.
					There is a power community for political events. And yet the artist is way ahead
					of politics in a way. The lesbian art community could never get the support
					which the lesbian political community can receive."</p>
				<p>"I was never very much accepted by the lesbian radical community. I was mystical
					and religious. I had had this background of being involved with men, but at the
					same time, 1 had always known <persName key="Agnes Martin" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q275610">Agnes Martin</persName> and written about her.... Then I went

					to work with the Byrd Hoffman School. The Byrd Hoffman School was creating art
					out of personal madness. It was a predominantly homosexual community. Ifound it
					personally very helpful. That community was rather like <persName key="Harry Stack Sullivan" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q354331">Harry Stack Sulli</persName>Â¬
					van's homosexual ward at Shepherd Pratt Hospital. The idea of a healing

					community, people healing each other. I came out in that group."</p>
				<p>"Itâs becoming clearer to me, on hearing everybody talk, that if we donât get a
					community together weâre not going to survive. I have seen so many brilliant
					womenâ with all kinds of personal powerâfail. They have killed themselves, gone
					mad, dissipated their energies. With all the pride of lesbiana we could all
					still go down the drain."</p>
				<p>"We are a group of people who have traditionally been <pb n="21" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue03/Issue3_images/issue3_023.jpg"/> covert,
					secretive, about every move we make. You can't come out on the job, you can't
					tell your parents, youre not sure you want to tell your kids yet. Itâs such a
					tradiÂ¬ tional pattern to be secretive that it's like a story about a bunch of
					prospectors who couldnât sit next to each other on the porch because they might
					shoot each other ij somebody got too close. Secretiveness breeds a very
					territorial sense about protection and armament."</p>
				<p>"I certainly think that we have the least options in terms of funding, money,
					gallery space, critics. If we want to be visible there are no options. At all.

					God forbid that there should be a lesbian show in the <placeName key="Museum of Modern Art" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q188740">Museum of Modern Art</placeName> and

					that somebody would condescendingly write about it in <orgName key="The New York Times" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9684">The New York Times</orgName>. The
					last thing they would see is the painting. 1 always get told by men how angry I
					am, how hostile I am, how domineering I am. And lâm sure 1 am. I think that
					because lesbians are the outcasts of the sexual world, much more so than male
					homosexuals, by being pariahs or lepers we have a sort of honesty of
					despair."</p>
				<p>"If there was more of a connection for my work, more of a lesbian art community,
					it might ease up some of my panic about putting my work out into a totally
					remote space."</p>
				<p>âThe idea of community is slightly threatening because of the fact that it
					involves more commitments to other people. The more I become involved with
					painting, the fewer people 1 want around me."</p>
				<p>"I think that what we are looking for is intelligent, inspirational material from
					other human beings. And honest feedback...I am looking for a creative milieu in
					which to function."</p>
				<p>âWhat lâve been hunting for is a type of community in which the life as well as
					the art give caliber to the spirit." âCommunity is hard because of the demons of
					jealousy and competitiveness."</p>
				<p>"Everyone here has stated that what we respect is rigor and discipline in
					ourselves. I would like a community that has that commitment."</p>
				<p>"One thing lâve found out over the years of being very idealistic about
					collaboration is that collaboration is usually about who gets to be president.
					Itâs a very politi- cal act that I donât think is possible outside of primitive
					tribes where people are structured to do a dance together, for centuries, for
					religious purposes."</p>
				<p>âThere is great difficulty in developing language in an historically male
					culture, with a male esthetic system, being taught by males that <persName key="Jackson Pollock" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37571">Jackson Pollock</persName>
					was the painter. Of course I like <persName key="Fra Angelico" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5664">Fra Angelico</persName> and of course I like <persName key="Giotto" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7814">Giotto</persName>, and
					of course I am inspired by <persName key="Edgar Degas" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q46373">Degas</persName>. But I think our problem is to develop a valid
					female esthetic system, a female language with almost no precedents."</p>
				<p>"I feel that it is very important for women to assert being lesbians, to assert
					being totally feminine, because I think a female support system of sexual
					sympathy is very necessary in the arts."</p>


				<p>"We must develop a context for womenâs art, which is influenced by so much of
					what you are describing. We must ask questions, is there a feminist sensibility,
					or even a lesbian sensibility? We make art in the context of other art...and we
					need the context of other women's art to make our own art unique. The visible
					art is the male art; that is the art that affects us. The other art which has
					affected me I have sought out, such as the art of non-Western cultures or
					non-white art. And now, the beginning visibility of the art of other women. It
					is a very slow process. The more visibility the better. The more we talk about
					our work, the better. Out of this, something will emerge which is clearer about
					who we are as artists, as mothers, and as lesbians."</p>
				<p>Information about the participants in The Tapes: all are white and
					college-educated; four of the women are mothers; two are from working-class
					backgrounds three from upper-middle-class backgrounds; and six from middle-class
					backgrounds. All live in <placeName key="New York City" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60">New York City</placeName>. We range in age from twenty-one to
					forty-five years. Two women have identified as lesbians for about eighteen
					years, the rest from one to four years. One woman is in art school, six are
					painters, one woman is involved in ritual performance and makes sculpture, one
					is presently making a theater piece, and one is a photographer. Some of us work
					part-time jobs, a couple of us teach and collect unemployment when we can, and
					one of us works full-time. All of the women, except for two, are in the

					collective responsible for the third issue of Heresies. Participants for the
					three sessions were Bestsy Crowell, <persName key="Betsy Damon" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q43078535">Betsy Damon</persName>, <persName key="Louise Fishman" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6688739">Louise Fishman</persName>, <persName key="Harmony Hammond" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5659529">Harmony
