      	<head>Object into Subject: Some Thoughts on the Work of Black Women Artists</head>
      	<byline><persName>Michelle Cliff</persName></byline>
         <p>
				In my room there is a postcard of a sculpture
				by the Venetian artist <persName>Danese Cattaneo</persName>, done in
				the mid-16th century—Black Venus. The full-
				length nude figure is bronze. In one hand she
				holds a hand-mirror in which she is looking at
				herself. On her head is a turban, around the
				edges of which her curls are visible. In her other
				hand she carries a cloth—or at least what ap
				pears to be a cloth. Who was she? A slave? Per
				haps in the artist's own household, or maybe that
				of his patron—one of the many Black women
				dragged from Africa to enter the service of white
				Europeans. I have no idea who she actually was:
				she was an object, then as now.</p>
				<p>Around this image are other images of Black
				women: Bernadette Powell, who killed the man
				who beat her and is now in Bedford Hills; Fannie
				Lou Hamer; Billie Holiday; Elizabeth Freeman,
				who sued for her freedom and won it, in Massachusetts in the 19th century; Josephine Baker;
				Harriet Tubman, portrayed in a linocut by Eliza
				beth Catlett; women students making basket furniture at the Hampton Institute; Lucy Parsons;
				Ida B. Wells-Barnett; Audre Lorde; Phillis Wheatley; two women in Botswana seated around a
				gourd; Sojourner Truth; women in the Black Liberation Movement in England; Betye Saar's Aunt
				Sally HooDoo; a girlchild balancing a basin on
				her head in southern Africa.</p>
				<p>My moving toward the study of the work—
				written and visual—of Black women has been a
				moving toward my own wholeness. My interest in
				this work is a deeply personal interest, because
				through these words and images I begin to cap
				ture part of who I am.</p>
				<p>I should begin with my title—“Object into
				Subject." What does it mean? We live in a society
				whose history is drenched in the philosophy and
				practice of racism, the oppression of Black and
				other Third World peoples. This is the point at
				which my definition begins: If you study racism—
				if you understand the history of the United States
				—you will find that under racism the person who
				is oppressed is turned into an object <note>connecting to the Suject Object binary, at what point do POC loose their subjecthood? Are they never interperlated?</note>in the mind
				of the oppressor.</p>
				<p>The white anti-racist southern writer Lillian
				Smith was among the first to offer a metaphysical
				and psychological explanation of racism as a
				personal and political American practice.<note>1. For Lillian Smith's definition of racism, see "The
					Mob and the Ghost“ and "Words That Chain Us
					and Words That Set Us Free," in The Winner
					Names the Age, ed. Michelle Cliff (New York:
					Norton, 1978</note>. One
				essential to the maintenance of things as they are
				in this society. Smith—whose influences included
				Kierkegaard, Jung, Freud, and Sartre—traced
				the origins of racism, and its more apparent
				manifestation, segregation, to that place in the
				human mind she called "mythic": that place
				where dreams, fantasies, and images begin;
				where they continue and take form as art, literature, politics, religion. The mythic mind is a
				source of psychic energy—it contributes the motion necessary for sustained thought. But the
				mythic mind needs a structure in which to function, so that its products will be understood. This
				structure is provided by reason. Reason, Smith
				argued, is merely a technic, an enabler; its sole purpose is to create the form which will support
				the ideas moving out of the mythic mind. Reason
				is incapable of moral judgment, and therefore
				will support any idea or image, regardless of its
				moral basis.</p>
				<p>When the mythic idea <note>this does not mix with what I would say is the structure</note> of whiteness, the obsession with skin color which is the irrational
				and immoral basis of racism, is given a construct
				from which the myth takes its form—i.e., the
				philosophy of white supremacy—the result is cultural or institutionalized racism, contained in the
				politics, literature, art, and religion of the dominant culture. An insane idea now exists within a
				reasonable reality, not an irrational dream.
				Whatever we may feel about Smith's analysis,
				or her sources for that matter, her treatment of
				American racism as something embedded in the
				white mind, regenerating itself within a psychological construct, is extremely important. She
				recognized early on the character of racism as in
				a sense  larger than life," something which could
				not be removed by congressional legislation or
				Supreme Court decisions, unless these actions
				were the result of a completely radicalized mind
				set within the dominant culture. I think that the
				resurgence of white racism in this country today
				bears witness to her understanding.
				Within the rationale reason lends to racism,
				Smith argued, is the practice of objectification,
				an absolute necessity in the racist effort to op
				press. (I use the word "effort" because it is and
				has been so; one which has been carried on on
				every level of this society, against constant, his
				toric opposition.) Through objectification—the
				process by which people are dehumanized, made
				ghostlike, given the status of Other—an image
				created by the oppressor replaces the actual
				being. The actual being is then denied speech;
				denied self-definition, self-realization; and over
				arching all this, denied selfhood—which is after
				all the point of objectification. A group of human
				beings—a people—are denied their history, their
				language, their music. Their cultural values are
			</p>
         <p>
				ignored. This history, this language, this music,
				these values exist in the subculture, but in the
				dominant culture only certain elements are cho
				sen, recast, co-opted, and made available to the
				definition of these people. And these elements
				presented by the dominant culture tend to serve
				the purpose of objectification and, therefore,
				oppression.
				The practice of objectification stands be
				tween all Black people and full human identity
				under the white supremacist system: racism re
			</p>
         <pb n="2"/>
         <p>
				quires that Black people be thought different
				from white; and this difference is usually trans
				lated as less than. This requirement has been
				stated in various ways throughout the history of
				America. Did you know, for example, that Thomas
				Jefferson held the popular view that the Black
				race was created when Black women mated with
				orangutans?? (I do not know where the original
				Black women were supposed to have come from.)
				Last October on my local PBS station I watched
				the film Birth of a Nation, introduced by a rather
				hearty film buff as an American classic, the work
				of a "tragic poet." I had never seen the movie,
				nor had I read the book The Clansman, upon
				which it is based. I felt I "had to watch it." The
				first thing I noticed was that all the Black charac
				ters were portrayed by white actors in "black
				face." Throughout the film the thing most evident
				to me was that this was a playing-out of a white
				American's image of Black people, crude and
				baroque to be sure, but not that far removed from
				Gone with the Wind (another American classic),
				or even from such white-inspired television pro
				grams as The Jeffersons." If anything, the very
				coarse brutality of Birth of a Nation is closer to
				the history of the slavocracy than perhaps any
				other American film. I could see as I watched this
				film how white people were capable of commit
				ting both the acts of the slave period and the
				lynchings which flourished during Reconstruc
				tion and thereafter. D. W. Griffiths's imaginings
				of Black women and men attempted to justify this
				history by replacing a people with the fantasies
				of his tragically racist mind. The very title gives
				his intention away.
				The playwright and activist Lorraine Hans
				berry, in her essay The New Paternalists,"
				observed:
				America long ago fell in love with an image. It is a
				sacred image, fashioned over centuries of time: this
				image of the unharried, unconcerned, glandulatory,
				simple, rhythmic, amoral, dark creature who was,
				above all else, a miracle of sensuality. It was cre
			</p>
         <p>
				ated, and it persists, to provide a personified pres
				sure valve for fanciful longings in [white] American
				dreams, literature, and life.... I think, for example,
				of that reviewer writing in a Connecticut news
				paper about A Raisin in the Sun... and marvelling,
				in the rush of a quite genuine enthusiasm, that the
				play proved again that there was a quaint loveli
				ness in how our  dusky brethren" can come up with
				a song and hum their troubles away. It did not seem
				to disturb him one whit that there is no single allu
				sion to that particular mythical gift in the entire
				play. He did not need it there; it was in his head.3
				Just as this white reviewer could hear Black peo
				ple humming as he watched Hansberry's play,
				others could declare it a play about insurance
				money, one which proved that all Black people
				really wanted was to live alongside whites. Many
				white people perceived the ending of Raisin as
				happy," unaware perhaps of what it meant for
				a Black family to move into a white neighborhood
				in Chicago in the post-World War II years. Did
				any of these white people know of Hansberry's
				own childhood experience when her family moved
				into a white Chicago neighborhood? The response
				to this move was white violence: the eight-year
				old Hansberry had a brick thrown through her
				bedroom window by the white mob. Her father,
				supported by the NAACP, took the case all the
				way to the Supreme Court and established a
				precedent for nondiscriminatory housing—but
			</p>
         <p>
				nothing in Chicago actually changed.
				If anything, the ending of Raisin is hopeful,
				not happy. And the hopefulness one feels derives
				not from any expectation of a white change-of
				heart, but from the fact that Hansberry has
				tested her characters throughout the play and
				they have emerged as people of integrity, capable
				of facing reality and white racism. She was, I
				think, attempting to create Black characters who
				would disrupt white imagery of Black people. But
				many in her audience could only see these char
				acters through their own screen of objectifica
				tion.
				It is objectification that gives the impression
				of sanity to the process of oppression. The cen
				turies-old image of which Hansberry speaks,
				actually a collection of images, is necessary to
				maintain racism. To hate with no justification for
				hatred, to oppress with no reason for oppression,
				would be recognizably insane. Once an object is
				provided—an object endowed by the oppressor
				with characteristics that allow hatred, that allow
				oppression—then hatred and oppression of the
				object can be defended as logical. An insane idea
				has been made rational. Lillian Smith portrayed
				this basic insanity of segregation in the South she
				knew:
				As I sit here writing, I can almost touch that little
				town, so close is the memory of it. There it lies, its
				main street lined with great oaks, heavy with matted
				moss that swings softly even now as I remember. A
				little white town rimmed with Negroes, making a
				deep shadow on the whiteness. There it lies, broken
				in two by one strange idea. Minds broken in tuen
				Hearts broken. Conscience torn from acts. A culture
				split into a thousand pieces. That is segregation. I
				am remembering: a woman in a mental hospital
				walking four steps out, four steps in, unable to go
				any further because she has drawn an invisible line
				around her small world and is terrified to take one
				step beyond it.... A man in a Disturbed Ward as
				signing places" to the other patients and violently
				insisting that each stay in his place.4
				"Segregation," for Smith, described a phenome
			</p>
         <p>
				non deeper than legal statute or town custom.
				She saw segregation as a form of dichotomizing
				within the white Western male tradition. She ob
				served, for example, that white women are seg
				regated from Black women and also objectified
				within the dominant culture:
				Another split took place.... Somehow much in the
				white woman that (man] could not come to terms
				with, the schizophrenic split he had made in her
				nature—the sacred madonna and the bitch he had
				created of her—could now be projected, in part,
				onto another female: under slavery, he could keep
				his pure white "madonna" and have his dark tem
				pestuous "prostitute."... Back of southern people's
				fear of giving up segregation is this fear of giving up
				the dark woman" who has become a symbol which
				the men no longer wish to attach to their own
				womens
				Smith's observation is important: White and
				Black women were/are both objectified and split
				from one another. Ifeel that Smith oversimplified
				the split, however. For example, the sacred ma
				donna, in order to maintain her status (and most
				often she was intent on maintaining her status),
				had to objectify the Black woman according to
				the white male imagination. The white woman on
				the slave plantation knew that white men used
				rape against Black women. She knew that Black
				women were for the most part fieldhands, work
			</p>
         <p>
				ing alongside men—when they were pregnant,
				when they were nursing. The Black woman was
				made into a sex object, yes, but Smith's use of the
				word prostitute," even in quotes, suggests more
				choice than any slave woman ever had. It also
				denies or glosses over the use of rapism by white
				men against Black women as an instrument of
				terror, of oppression.
				Black women have been doubly objectified—
				as Black, as women; under white supremacy,
				under patriarchy. It has been the task of Black
				woman artists to transform this objectification:
				to become the subject commenting on the mean
				ing of the object, or to become the subject reject
				ing the object and revealing the real experience
				of being. In her essay In Search of Our Mother's
				Gardens," Alice Walker ponders the degree of
				difficulty faced by a Black woman in the United
				States with artistic ambition: "What did it mean
				for a black woman to be an artist in our grand
				mothers' time? In our great-grandmothers' day?
				It is a question with an answer cruel enough to
				stop the blood."
				In her novel Sula, Toni Morrison makes the
				following observation about the seemingly de
				structive nature of her main character:
				In a way, her strangeness, her naiveté, her craving
				for the other half of her equation was the conse
				quence of an idle imagination. Had she paints, or
				clay, or knew the discipline of the dance, or strings;
				had she anything to engage her tremendous curi
				osity and her gift for metaphor, she might have ex
				changed the restlessness and preoccupation with
				whim for an activity that provided her with all she
				yearned for. And like any artist with no art form,
				she became dangerous. 7
				Sula's tragedy, and the tragedy she represents,
				is "cruel enough to stop the blood." Because of
				her race, perhaps also because of her sex, she
				has been shut out from art and denied access to
				art forms. She is an intelligent, thinking woman,
				who ultimately has nowhere to go.
				The objectification of Black women has taken
			</p>
         <p>
				many forms: The Mammy, Mama—wetnurse,
				midwife, cook—usually large, usually dark, com
				bining humility and capability. The temptress,
				sex-object, whore—sometimes mulatto (from the
				Latin for mule, i.e., a creature unable to repro
				duce herself)—misbegotten and tragic, the power
				of the master coursing through her powerless
				veins. These are but two examples which recur
				in white Western literature and art. And these
				have been repeated by white women as well as
				white men. There is, of course, "Mammy" in
				Gone with the Wind; and there is Julie, the woe
				begone quadroon in Edna Ferber's Showboat.
				Another novel, Imitation of Life by Fanny Hurst,
				attempts to "deal with" both Mammy and mu
				latto.
				By many accounts, Fanny Hurst was a well
				intentioned liberal. Much has been made, for ex
				ample, of the fact that she employed Zora Neale
				Hurston as her secretary in 1925. But some of
				that history suggests Hurst's insensitivity to Hur
				ston's identity as a Black woman, not to mention
				a brilliant novelist and writer, among whose sub
				jects was the self-definition of Black women. On
				one occasion Hurst, intent on integrating a res
				taurant in Vermont, prevailed upon Hurston to
			</p>
         <pb n="3"/>
         <p>
				accompany her—passing Hurston off as an Af
				rican princess." Hurston remarked, "Who would
				have thought that a good meal could be so bit
				ter." In this incident Hurst, the would-be liber
				ator, reveals herself as objectifier. This phenom
				enon occurred over and again during the Civil
				Rights Movement. It was most commonly ex
				pressed in the notion that unless Black people
				behaved in certain ways, allowing whites to over
				see and control their access to liberation, that
				liberation would not be achieved. What is pres
				ent is the need for whites to maintain power, and
				limit the access of Black people to that power,
				which, finally, is the power of self-definition.
				Imitation of Life, published in 1933, concerns
				the relationship between two dyads: a white
				woman and her daughter and a Black woman
				and her daughter. Both pairs are essentially
				alone in the world. The Black woman, Delilah, is
				hired to run the house by the white woman, Miss
				B., who has been recently widowed. Delilah car
				ries with her various recipes, and these prove to
				be the "salvation" of Miss B. and family. In a
				relatively short time, Miss B. is the proprietor of
				a chain of restaurants in which Delilah's food is
				the main attraction, and which are recognized by
				a likeness of Delilah on the sign. When Miss B.
				hits on the idea of photographing Delilah as the
				advertising gimmick for the enterprise, she
				dresses Delilah as a chef. Delilah, faithful ser
				vant throughout the book, in this one instance
				asks her employer not to humiliate her but to al
				low her to wear her best clothes.
				Miss B., however, prevails. Hurst describes
				the final result: "Breaking through a white back
				ground, as through a paper-covered hoop, there
				burst the chocolate-and-cream effulgence that
				was Delilah."2 Here is Aunt Jemima; the female
				server of Sanka; even Mrs. Butterworth, whose
				color literally pours forth. Here is an instance of
				the brainchild of a Black woman, her recipe, her
				art form, passed through generations of Black
				women, co-opted and sold, with a caricature of
				the artist used to ensure its success.
				In and around the main theme of the novel
				the "success" of Miss B. as an independent
				businesswoman"—is the subplot concerning De
				lilah's light-skinned daughter, Peola—unable to
				be white, unwilling to be Black, in the course of
				her dilemma denying her mother. Peola moves
				west, works as a librarian, passes for white, and
				marries a white man. She has herself "steri
				lized," eliminating any chance of throwback.'
				Her husband is also mutilated, having lost part of
				a hand. Perhaps he is all she is entitled to. Delilah
				has the final say: "Black women who pass, pass
				into damnation.
				Taken together, Delilah and Peola represent
				what George Frederickson has characterized as
				soft" and hard" stereotypes.10 Bell Hooks also
				juxtaposes two stereotypes of Black women:
				Mammy and Sapphire.
				It is not too difficult to imagine how whites came to
				create the black mammy figure.... She was first
				36
			</p>
         <p>
				and foremost asexual and consequently had to be
				fat (preferably obese); she also had to give the im
				pression of not being clean so she was the wearer of
				a greasy dirty headrag; her too tight shoes from
				which emerged her large feet were further confir
				mation of her bestial cowlike quality. Her greatest
				virtue was of course her love for white folk which
				she willingly and passively served.... In a sense
				whites created in the mammy figure a black woman
				who embodied solely those characteristics they as
				colonizers wished to exploit. 11
				As Sapphires, black women were depicted as evil,
				treacherous, bitchy, stubborn, and hateful, in short
				all that the mammy was not. White men could justify
				their de-humanization and sexual exploitation of
				black women by arguing that they possessed inher
				ent evil demonic qualities.... And white women
				could use the image of the evil sinful black woman
				to emphasize their own innocence and purity. 12
				To talk about the history of Black women in
				America, and of the various images I have men
				tioned, we must begin with the woman who was a
				slave. Who was she? How did she survive? How
				many of her did survive? What did she teach her
				children? What was her relationship to her hus
				band? What were her options?
				She could be lynched, beaten, tortured, muti
				lated, raped. She could have her children sold
				away from her. She was forbidden education.
				She was considered a beast of burden. She was
				subject to the white man's power and the white
				woman's powerlessness masking as whim. Her
				womb was a commodity of the slavemaster, and
				her childlessness, a liability of the slavemaster.
				She was not expected to love—but she did. She
				was not expected to run away—but she did. She
				was known to commit infanticide and induce
				abortion rather than have her child be a slave.
				She was known to commit acts of violence and
				rebellion—with magic, poison, force, even with
				spit. And she sometimes learned to read and
				write and sustain the art forms she had carried
				with her.
				In 1960 Lorraine Hansberry was commis
				sioned to write a play about slavery for national
				television. She wrote The Drinking Gourd, about
				a Black family and a white family under slavery.
				In it, as in Raisin, Hansberry attempted to con
				tradict the myths about Black people and to re
				capture and recast history. Her play was never
				performed; it was judged "too controversial" by
				the network. Hansberry had described Lena
				Younger, her mother-figure in Raisin, as an af
				firmation," as
				the black matriarch incarnate, the bulwark of the
				Negro family since slavery, the embodiment of the
				Negro will to transcendence. It is she, who in the
				mind of the black poet scrubs the floors of a nation
				in order to create black diplomats and university
				professors. It is she, while seeming to cling to tradi
				tional restraints, who drives the young on into the
				fire hoses. And one day simply refuses to move to
				the back of the bus in Montgomery. Or goes out and
				buys a house in an all-white neighborhood where
				her children may possibly be killed by bricks thrown
				through the windows by a shrieking racist mob. 13
			</p>
         <p>
				With her mother-figure in The Drinking Gourd,
				Hansberry went further. Rissa, the slavemother,
				does what the Black mother-figure in white Amer
				ican mythology has never done: She, in effect,
				kills a white man (the "good" white man), and
				gives his guns to her children, after her son has
				been blinded for learning to read. The play ends
				as Rissa and her band of revolutionaries escape
				into the woods.
				We know that Black women—mothers and
				nonmothers—have been intrinsic to the activism
				of Black history. There is the following story, for
				example, quoted by Angela Davis:
				She didn’t work in the field. She worked at a loom.
				She worked so long and so often that once she went
				to sleep at the loom. Her master's boy saw her and
				told his mother. His mother told him to take a whip
				and wear her out. He took a stick and went out to
				beat her awake. He beat my mother till she woke
				up. When she woke up, she took a pole out of the
				loom and beat him nearly to death with it. He hol
				lered, "Don't beat me no more, and I won't let 'em
				whip you."
				She said, I'm going to kill you. These black titties
				sucked you, and then you come out here to beat
				me." And when she left him, he wasn't able to walk.
				And that was the last I seen of her until after free
				dom. She went out and got an old cow that she used
				to milk—Dolly, she called it. She rode away from
				the plantation because she knew they would kill her
				if she stayed. 14
			</p>
         <p>
				This story tells of a Black woman in the act of
				freeing herself. A selfish need for freedom, and a
				recognition that freedom is their right, is some
				thing usually denied to Black women historically,
				even when they are recognized as liberators of
				their race. But Fannie Lou Hamer, Ida B. Wells,
				Mary McLeod Bethune, Sojourner Truth—and
				the many women whose names we do not know—
				all felt a personal desire for freedom, which came
				from a feeling of self-esteem, self-worth, and they
				translated this into a political commitment that
				their people also be free. Harriet Tubman said:
				Ilooked at my hands to see if I was de same person
				now I was free. Dere was such a glory ober ebery
				thing, de sun came like gold trou de trees, and ober
				de fields, and I felt like I was in heaven.
				I had crossed de line of which I had so long been
				dreaming. I was free; but dere was no one to wel
				come me to de land of freedom, I was a stranger in a
				strange land, and my home after all was down in de
				ole cabin quarter, wid de ole folks, and my brudders
				and sisters. But to dis solemn resolution I came;
				was free, and dey should be free also; I would make
				a home for dem in de North, and de Lord helping
				me, I would bring dem all dere. 15
				The artist, like the liberator, must begin with
				herself.
				Edmonia Lewis (1843-1900?) is the first wom
				an of color we know whose work as a visual artist
				was recognized by the dominant culture. During
				her life as a sculptor she was confronted with the
				objectification of herself as Black and female.
			</p>
         <pb n="4"/>
         <p>
				While her work was not ignored, it was given a
				secondary place of importance by most critics.
				Lewis was seen as a "wonder," a work of art in
				herself—a curiosity. The following excerpt from
				an abolitionist newspaper describes the artist
				and her marble group Forever Free (1867):
				No one... could look upon this piece of sculpture
				without profound emotion. The noble figure of the
				man, his very muscles seeming to swell with grati
				tude; the expression of the right now to protect,
				with which he throws his arms around his kneeling
				wife; the Praise de Lord" hovering on their lips;
				the broken chain—all so instinct with life, telling
				in the very poetry of stone the story of the last ten
				years. And when it is remembered who created this
				group, an added interest is given to it.... Will any
				one believe it was the small hand of a girl that
				wrought the marble and kindled the light within it?
				—a girl of dusky hue, mixed Indian and African,
				who not more than eight years ago sat down on the
				steps of City Hall to eat the dry crackers with which
				alone her empty purse allowed her to satisfy her
				hunger; but as she sat and thought... of her home
				less state, something caught her eye, the hunger of
				the stomach ceased, but the hunger of the soul
				began. That quiet statue of the good old Franklin.
				kindled the latent genius which was enshrined with
				in her, as her own group was in marble, till her
				chisel brought it out. For weeks she haunted that
				spot and the State House, where she could see
				Washington and Webster. She asked questions, and
				found that such things were first made in clay. She
				got a lump of hard mud, shaped her some sticks,
			</p>
         <p>
				and, her heart divided between art and the terrible
				need for freedom.. she wrought out... an admir
				able bust of [Col. Robert Gould Shaw, white Bos
				tonian commander of a company of Black troops
				organized due to pressure from Frederick Doug-
				lass). 16
				When this article was written Lewis was a well
				known sculptor living in Rome, with a degree in
				liberal arts from Oberlin College. She had studied
				sculpture with Edward Brackett, a prominent
				neoclassical artist. She was not particularly in
				terested in creating likenesses of Franklin, Wash
				ington, or Webster—her interest in these pieces
				would have been purely technical, not inspira
				tional. The only leader" of white America she
				ever depicted was Abraham Lincoln. All her
				other subjects were drawn from her history as
				the daughter of a Black man and a Chippewa
				woman, and her consciousness of racism.
				Just as the author patronizes the artist, so
				does he minimize the political statement of her
				work. For instance, he uses the word "gratitude"
				rather than "pride," or triumph," in his com
				ments on the male figure; he focuses on the arm
				which embraces the woman, rather than on the
				hand which is raised, the broken chain dangling
				from the wrist. He cites the struggle of the last
				ten" years with typical white solipsism. In addi
				tion, his "Praise de Lord" does not allow us
				knowledge of the politics of Black Americans, to
				which religion has been historically intrinsic.
				Rather, it can be read in such a way that the
				triumph is taken from the hands of those who
			</p>
         <p>
				have won it and placed somewhere "out there.'
				It is commonly believed that the slaves were
				freed by white Northerners. But as W. E. B.
				Du Bois observed: "In proportion to population,
				more Negroes than whites fought in the Civil
				War. These people, withdrawn from the support
				of the Confederacy, with the threat of the with
				drawal of millions more, made the opposition of
				the slaveholder useless, unless they themselves
				freed and armed their own slaves." 17 The jour
				ney out of slavery was one in which Black people
				played a dominant role. It is this that Lewis is
				commemorating in her work. She had earlier
				commemorated the slave-woman in her piece
				Freedwoman on First Hearing of Her Liberty
				(which has been lost to us).
				In an interview with the Lorain County News,
				Lewis spoke of her childhood:
				My mother was a wild Indian and was born in
				Albany, of copper color and with straight black
				hair. There she made and sold moccasins. My fath
				er, who was a Negro, and a gentleman's servant,
				saw her and married her. Mother often left home
				and wandered with her people, whose habits she
				could not forget, and thus we were brought up in
				the same wild manner. Until I was twelve years old,
				I led this wandering life, fishing and swimming...
				and making moccasins. 18
				Alice Walker speaks about looking "high—and
				low" for the artistic antecedents of Black women;
				she speaks specifically of her own mother's gar
			</p>
         <p>
				den—how this was the place of her mother's cre
				ative expression, the background against which
				Walker's own work proceeded: "Guided by my
				heritage of a love of beauty and a respect for
				strength—in search of my mother's garden I
				found my own." This statement makes me think
				of Lewis's mother, her independence and her
				craft. The fact that she trained her daughter in
				her art form. That she taught her strength.
				Lewis's sculpture, because she chose primari
				ly to depict subjects directly related to her own
				and her people's experience, has a certain pow
				er. Where her pieces lose power is in the style
				she adopted and the material she used: the neo
				classical style, with its emphatic focus on Greek
				idealization, and the pristine whiteness of the
				marble, which supports the narrowness of the
				style—so that a black face must appear white
				and be carved according to principles of beauty
				which are white, "fine" features as perfection.
				The 19th century was the century of jubilee, of a
				women's movement, and of a revolutionary move
				ment in Europe. But these moral reactions need
				to be understood against the immorality which
				dominated that century: the "white man's bur
				den," the political/religious/economic affirma
				tion of the supremacy of the white race. The neo
				classical style arose quite naturally from all this,
				based as it was on the imitation of fifth-century
				Athens, a slave-owning, gynephobic society, but
				one popularly regarded as high-minded and dem
				ocratic. In Lewis's Forever Free the limitations
				placed on a Black and Indian artist working in
			</p>
         <p>
				this style and with this material are evident: the
				curly hair of the male figure and the broken
				chain are the only signs that these are people of
				color.
				Of her sculpture Hagar (1875), Lewis said: "I
				have a strong sympathy for all women who have
				struggled and suffered."2 Again, we have to look
				beyond the actual figure to the story Lewis is
				illustrating to find the political/historical state
				ment in her work. Hagar was an Egyptian, a
				woman of color, the slave of Abraham's wife,
				Sarah. Hagar was "given" to Abraham by Sarah
				so that he might have an heir; and she was the
				mother of his first-born son, Ishmael. Then Isaac
				was born to Abraham and Sarah. The book of
				Genesis continues the story:
				Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she
				had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac.
				So she said to Abraham, Cast out this slave woman
				with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall
				not be heir with my son Isaac." And the thing was
				very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
				But God said to Abraham, "Be not displeased be
				cause of the lad and because of your slave woman;
				whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for
				through Isaac shall your descendents be named.
				So Abraham rose early in the morning... and sent
				[Hagar] away. And she departed, and wandered in
				the wilderness of Beer-sheba.21
				It is quite impossible to read this story and ne
				think of the Black woman under slavery, rape
			</p>
         <p>
				by the white master, serving the white master's
				wife, bearing a child by the white master, and
				bearing the responsibility for that child—with no
				power over her own fate, or that of her child.
				Lewis's choice of Hagar as a symbol for Black
				slave-women also fits into the Black tradition in
				America, one immersed in the stories of the Bible
				(often the Bible was the only access slaves had to
				the written word), and characterized by the
				translation of these stories according to Black
				history.
				In reading this account from Genesis, I am
				also thrown back to Lillian Smith's description of
				the split between Black and white women. It is
				Sarah who is made responsible for the banish
				ment of Hagar. Her husband and his god remain
				blameless, even noble.
				After approximately ten years of recognition,
				Edmonia Lewis disappeared." This sort of fall
				ing out of fame is usually seen as tragic, but I
				wonder what happened to her? Was her disap
				pearance by choice? Or did she disappear be
				cause she was a Black woman artist who was no
				longer in vogue, because she was no longer seen
				as "exotic“?
				In contrast to Lewis's white marble sculp
				tures, Elizabeth Catlett's figures are done in
				brown wood or terra cotta, or another material
				which suggests the color of her subjects, or at
				least that her subjects are people of color. No
				white Western features replace the character
				istics of Black and other Third World people. But
				Catlett is a contemporary artist, one who rela
				37

         <pb n="5"/>
         <p>
				tively early in her career left this country and
				moved to a country of colored people—Mexico
				Yet her piece Homage to My Young Black
				Sisters (1969), when we make allowances over
			</p>
         <p>
				time and across space, is not that far removed in
				political intent from Lewis's Hagar. In form the
				differences are enormous: Hagar's hands are
				clasped in front of her, in resignation, in suppli
				cation—in the wilderness she has to turn to
				Abraham's god to save the life of her son. The
				female figure of Homage has one arm raised in a
				powerful and defiant fist. The similarity betweer
				the two pieces is that both, I think, represent part
				of the history of Black women, particularly Black
				motherhood, in America. The midsection of the
				Homage figure is an open space, which I take as
				Catlett's statement of the historical white denia
				of Black women's right to motherhood in any self
				defining way, and of the theft of the children of
				Black women, and of what these children repre
				sent—whether through the laws of the slavocra
				cy or those of postindustrial America.
				Catlett uses the theme of Black women and
				children often in her work, depicting over anc
				again the heroism required of Black women sim
			</p>
         <p>
				ply to survive. In her lithographs, engravings
				and linocuts, Catlett seeks to tell the history of
				Black women, breaking away from the objectifi
				cation of the dominant culture. We might, for ex
				ample, look at her wood engraving of Harriet
				Tubman (1975), in contrast to Judy Chicago's
				Sojourner Truth plate in the Dinner Party.22 Cat
				lett's Harriet dominates the foreground; one pow
				erful arm points forward, the other holds a rifle
				She is tall and she is strong and she is Black. In
				the background are the men and women she
				leads. What is interesting to me is the expression
				on Tubman's face—she is fiercely determined.
				This expression is repeated in the group she
				leads. There is no passivity here, no resignation,
				no impotent tears, no humming. Rather, this is
				a portrait of the activity of a people in conflict
				with their oppression.
				Catlett has stated that art should be obviously
				political, available to the people who are its sub
				ject. We have no such clear statement from
				Lewis, but we must wonder for whom her work
				was done, finally; and whether she stopped work
				ing as she did because of a distance between her
				art and her subjects.
				Harriet Powers (1837-1911) was a quilt-maker
				(only two of her quilts are known to survive). She
				worked in appliqué, a method of needlework de
				vised by the Fon of Dahomey, brought to this
				country on slave ships.23 Betye Saar is a collec
				tor; an artist who constructs images with various
				objects, mementos, photographs, bits and pieces
				picked up here and there and saved; things used
				in another context, by other hands. Both Powers
				and Saar endow their work with a belief in the
				spiritual nature of the ordinary. Powers's quilts,
				constructed from the scraps saved by a poor
				Black woman, convey a real portrait of one Black
				woman's religion and politics. Marie Jeane
				Adams states: The more one examines the style
				and content of Harriet Powers's work, the more
				one sees that it projects a grand spiritual vision
				24
				that breaks out of the confines of folk art.
				The employment of once-used objects by these
				artists is one aspect of their work which needs
				further thought. In the history of white Western
				art there is an obsession with the purity of mater
				ials. And also with their value. For one exam
				ple: In the art of 15th-century Italy, and even
				earlier, the color ultramarine was often used to
				depict the most important figure or feature in a
				painting or fresco. This choice was made with
				the knowledge that the color was created by
				crushing lapis lazuli, the most expensive source
				of pigment after gold.2 And this choice extended
				to the very meaning of the work produced. In the
				art of Powers and Saar, the sources of the artist's
				materials are also important, but the choice is
				more deeply personal. We might ask: How much
				does the power of a work of art consist in the
				material which makes up that work? What is the
				difference between a work of art made with
				things specifically employed in that work and
				never before, and one which uses only things
				used before? Is one more useful than the other?
				More magical than the other?
				We know of Harriet Powers's work partly be
				cause of a white woman—Jennie Smith, herself
				an artist—who left an 18-page monograph on the
				artist. She recorded the following in 1891, when
				Powers finally agreed to sell her a quilt:
				I found the owner, a negro woman, who lived in the
				country on a little farm whereon she and her hus
				band made a respectable living.... Last year I sent
				word that I would buy it if she still wanted to dis
				pose of it. She arrived one afternoon in front of my
				door...with the precious burden...encased in a
				clean crocus sack.
				She offered it for ten dollars, but I told her I only
			</p>
         <p>
				had five to give. After going out consulting with her
				husband she returned and said, "Owin' to de hard
				ness of de times, my old man lows I'd better teck
				hit. Not being a new woman she obeyed.
				After giving me a full description of each scene with
				great earnestness, she departed but has been back
				several times to visit the darling offspring of her
				brain. 26
				Powers's second quilt—now in the Boston
				Museum of Fine Arts—was commissioned in 1898
				by the wives of professors at Atlanta University.
				This quilt, known as the second Bible quilt, con
				sists of five columns, each divided into three
				frames. All the frames deal with the theme of
				God's vengeance and redemption, illustrated
				through Biblical images and representations of
				cataclysmic events in 18th- and 19th-century
				America.
				This. much-exhibited quilt portrays fifteen scenes.
				Ten are drawn from familiar Bible stories which
				concern the threat of God's judgment inextricably
				fused with His mercy and man's redemption, among
				which are the Fall, Moses in the wilderness, Job's
				trials, Jonah and the whale, the Baptism of Christ
				and the Crucifixion....Four others depict astro
				nomical or meteorological events, only one of which,
				an extremely cold spell in 1895 in the eastern United
				States, occurred in Mrs. Powers' adult life. Given
				Mrs. Powers' intensely religious outlook, she inter
				preted these events in the celestial atmosphere as
				messages from God to mankind about punishment,
				apocalypse, and salvation. 27
				The one frame which does not fit into this cate
				gorization is the one which, as Marie Jeane
				Adams observes, is the key to the quilt. Powers
				left a description in her own words of all the
				scenes in the quilt; of this particular frame, she
				said:
				Rich people who were taught nothing of God. Bob
				Johnson and Kate Bell of Virginia. They told their
				parents to stop the clock at one and tomorrow it
				would strike one and so it did. This was the signal
				that they had entered everlasting punishment. The
				independent hog which ran 500 miles from Ga. to
				Va. Her name was Betts. 28
				The frame has a clock in the center, stars and a
				moon scattered around, two human figures. At
				the bottom is the independent hog named Betts,
				the largest figure of the quilt. Metallic thread
				outlines the clockface and creates a tiara around
				the head of the white woman Kate Bell. Betts is
				made from gray cloth, but she is placed over a
			</p>
         <pb n="6"/>
         <p>
				swatch of orange so that her figure unmistakably
				stands out.
				This quilt represents a great spiritual vision,
				but it also represents a great political vision: as
			</p>
         <p>
				well as hope, it represents rage. It is a safe guess
				that Bob Johnson and Kate Bell of Virginia were a
				son and daughter of the slavocracy. They stand
				surounded by scenes representing the punish
				ment meted out to those who are arrogant and
				self-serving, and the redemption promised those
				who are righteous. In this particular frame it is
				their sin of pride which has damned them; and
				Powers is clear in her belief that their damnation
				is well-earned. In contrast is the dominating fig
				ure of Betts, who in an act of self-liberation goes
				free. Her 500-mile flight from Georgia to Virginia
				is, as Adams points out, a reference to one route
				traveled by runaway slaves. And Betts is undeni
				ably female—her teats hang down from her gray
				cloth body. I think of Dolly—the cow in the anec
				dote cited above—being ridden away by a Black
				woman. And I think of the white idea of Black
				women as beasts of burden, mules," farm ani
				mals; of the image of Harriet Tubman being
				forced to draw a wagon for the entertainment of
			</p>
         <p>
				white folks. I take Betts to be a metaphor for this
				experience. Angela Davis has quoted Frederick
				Law Olmstead's description of a slave crew in
				Mississippi returning from the fields:
			</p>
         <p>
				[I saw] forty of the largest and strongest women I
				ever saw together; they were all in a simple uniform
				dress of a bluish check stuff; their legs and feet
				were bare; they carried themselves loftily, each
				having a hoe over the shoulder, and walking with a
				free, powerful swing like chausseurs on the march. 29
				It would be very simple to romanticize this
				group of women. But, as Davis says, it is not slav
				ery and the slave system that have made them
				strong; it is the experience of their labor and
				their knowledge of themselves as producers and
				creators. She quotes Marx: "labor is the living,
				shaping fire; it represents the impermanence of
				things, their temporality. Davis makes a brilli
				ant connection here:
				perhaps these women had learned to extract
				from the oppressive circumstances of their lives the
				strength they needed to resist the daily dehumani
				zation of slavery. Their awareness of their endless
				capacity for hard work may have imparted to them
			</p>
         <p>
				a confidence in their ability to struggle for them
				selves, their families and their people. 30
				Black women were not dehumanized under slav
				ery; they were dehumanized in white minds. I re
				turn again and again in my own mind to the ad
				jective "independent," which Powers uses to de
				scribe Betts, a "chasseur on the march.
				It is not that far a distance from Lewis's
				Hagar, to Catlett's Homage, to Powers's Betts, to
				Betye Saar's Aunt Jemima. Saar's construction,
				entitled The Liberation of Aunt Jemima, is per
				haps the most obvious illustration of what I mean
				by the title of this essay: "Object into Subject.'
				Here is the most popularized image of the Mammy
				— in the center of the piece she is a cookie jar,
				the source of nourishment for others; behind her
				are faces cut from the pancake mix. In front of
				the central figure is another image of Mammy,
				holding a white baby. And there is a broom along
				side the central figure. But she also holds a pistol
				and a rifle; and the skirt of Mammy with the
				white baby forms an unmistakable Black fist.
				Saar's message is clear: Aunt Jemima will free
				herself.
				In an interview in Black Art, Saar described
				the components she uses in her work:
				They are all found objects or discarded objects, so
				they have to be remnants. They are connected with
				another sensitivity so it has to be a memory of be
				longing to another object, or at least having another
				function. 31
				Aunt Jemima has been created by another sensi
				tivity than that of the artist who has made this
				portrait. Aunt Jemima has a memory of belonging
				to someone else, of being at the service of some
				one else. She exists against an image, which
				exists in another mind. The cookie jar is a rem
				nant of another life: most likely she "lived' on the
				kitchen counter of a white family, maybe Saar
				found her discarded on a white elephant table, or
				at a garage sale. She has appeared to me in my
				travels, usually turning up in rural antique stores
				or church basements, labeled "collectible. The
				picture of Mammy with the white baby reminds
				me first of old magazine advertisements, usually,
				as Irecall, for soap or cereal or other necessities
				of the servant role. And I additionally recall the
				many films of the '40s and '50s about white middle
				class America, in which a large Black woman
				who worked in the kitchen was always present
				but only occasionally given a line to speak. She
				was played by Louise Beavers, Hattie McDaniel,
				or Ethel Waters—and she was usually charac
				terized by her loyalty to the white family for
				whom she worked. She also appeared on televi
				sion: "Beulah" was a program in which she was
				featured. She was kind, honest, a good cook,
				always with a song to hum her troubles away;
				and as usual, devoted to those white folks.
				All but three of the elements in Saar's con
				struction are traditional to Aunt Jemima; the two
				guns and the fist are not. Saar, by including these
				unfamiliar aspects has changed the function of
				the figure she is representing. She has combined
				the myth with the reality of Black women's his
				toric opposition to their oppression.
				This representation of Aunt Jemima is star
				tling. All of us who have grown up with the mythi
				cal figure of Aunt Jemima and her equally mythi
				cal attributes—whether or not we recognized
				they were mythic—have been affected. We may
				not have known her, but aren't we somehow con
				vinced that somewhere she exists, or at least has
				existed? The last thing we would expect would be
				that she would carry a gun, or raise a hand. As a
				child in Jamaica I was taught that the women
				who worked for us were to be respected and
			</p>
         <pb n="7"/>
         <p>
				obeyed, and yet I remember my 12-year-old light
				skinned self exercising what I felt was my au
				thority over these women, and being quite taken
				aback when one of the women threatened to beat
				me—and my mother backed her up. Just as I was
				shocked to find that another houseworker had
				tied up my cousins and shut them on the veran
				dah because they were interfering with her work.
				So while we may know the image is an image,
				the expectations of Black women behaving ac
				cording to this image persist. As far as I can tell,
				Harriet Tubman carried both a carbine and a
				pistol. And she threatened to shoot any slave who
				decided to turn back on the journey north. Just as
				Lorraine Hansberry's slavemother armed her
				children and set out with them—after leaving a
				white man to die.
