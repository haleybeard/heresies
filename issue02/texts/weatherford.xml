			<div><p> Human culture has been viewed by history as the product of "mankind's" efforts.
				Most of the events and achievements chosen for posterity as significant have been
				dominated and determined by males. However, there are histories other than those of
				modern post-industrial nation/ states. In traditional societies, located in what is
				often called the Third World, women have played a crucial role in the formation of
				cultural features vital to human existence. One such area, not usually credited to
				women, is architecture. In traditional cultures, women are often the builders and
				owners of structures, providing shelter and creating the conditions for social
				interaction.</p>
			<p>Although I will use the "ethnographic present" in most of this article, many of the
				traditional non-state societies in North America and Africa on which I focus here no
				longer exist, or no longer exist in their original forms. Their structures differ
				vastly from those of modern states. Some of these societies are small bands of
				gatherers and hunters, some are semi-nomadic peoples who seasonally follow herds,
				and others pursue a form of farming called horticulture, where the local économy
				is self-sufficient and women are frequently the farmers.</p>
			<p>Initially victimized by colonization, virtually all those societies that remain are
				now undergoing "modernization.“ If we lose the histories of these cultures, we will
				also lose an important part of the history of women's roles in world culture, for in
				societies whose traditions remain intact, the roles women play are central to their
				cultures—not on the sidelines, where our culture seems to wish us to be. In light of
				this, contemporary feminists' identification and re-creation of "women's culture“
				can be seen not just as a protest against oppression, but as a recognition of the
				arbitrary denigration of the history of women's activities. The discovery that
				architecture is a traditional woman's art opens up the possibility for a new under¬
				standing of our role in the formation of human culture.</p>
			<p>
				<title>Grass Houses</title> Societies of gatherers and hunters lived in small bands,
				constantly moving within a relatively large territory from which they foraged for
				plants and animals. These groups, which include the (Kung of the Kalahari Desert in
				Namibia and the BaMbuti (Pygmies) of central Africa's Ituri Forest, bands in the
				Sahara Desert, Algonkian and Athabascan groups in North America, are intriguing in
				their social harmony and their knowledgeable, non-exploitative interaction with
				their environments. Women and men regard each other as equals. Among the BaMbuti,
				hunting is a joint effort, men care for babies and women enter public discussions.<note type="scholarNote">1. Colin Turnbull, The Forest People (New York: Natural History
					Library, 1962), pp. 156-157.</note></p>
			<p>In gathering societies women may provide up to eighty percent of the food and as an
				extension of their expertise in plants and fibers (with which they make nets), they
				are also the builders. The dwelling the women construct usually consists of a
				framework woven like an inverted loose basket, covered or thatched with available
				materials such as large leaves, bundles of grass or woven mats. These shelters
				share significant characteristics across cultures. They are flexible, often flooded
				with translucent light, and scented with the smoke of fires and fragrant floor cov¬
				erings. They are round, ovoid or conical, with no edges or planes to interrupt the
				flow of space. Their size and shape maximizes physical and psychological contact
				among the dwellers. Anthropologists suggest that such human proximity is particu¬
				larly conducive to intuitive and nonverbal communication, to the development of
				internalized cultural rhythms.<note type="scholarNote">2. Edward T. Hall, Beyond Culture (Garden City,
					N.Y.: Doubleday, 1976), Chap. 5, passim.</note> In our Western cultures, such
				tacit synchrony is usually found only in mother-infant relationships, a vestige
				of what was once the nature of communication between both sexes and all ages.</p>
			<p>A freudian theorist might suggest that the organic nature of gatherers' dwellings is
				a cultural extension of the biophysical environment of the womb. But in fact, these
				shelters can be extremely open and unwomblike. They include unsheltered areas where
				the work of the household, such as plaiting mats and scraping skins, <pb n="36"/>
				takes place. The house life overflows into outdoor space, allowing the activities of
				its inhabitants to expand. Many gatherers dwellings are easily adaptable, and when
				not easily expanded (as in the hemispherical scherms of the !Kung) there is
				flexibility as to who inhabits them. Children do not have to sleep with their
				parents, and can either stay with their grandparents or make camp with other
				children of the same sex at either end of the settlement.<note type="scholarNote">3. Patricia Draper,
					"IKung Women," in Toward an Anthropology of Women, ed. Rayna Reiter (New York:
					Monthly Review Press, 1975), p. 94.</note> Thus the gatherers' house is not a
				structure enforcing family isolation, but serves as a shelter of great social
				fluidity.</p>

			<p> In these mobile cultures land is not individually owned and no dwelling is per-
				manent. Women possess the building know-how rather than the actual structures,
				which they may erect collectively. The building activity may be almost ritualized,
				as the "performer“ sets into motion a body of traditional knowledge shared with
				other women:</p>
			<quote>Now she squatted down making her own home, driving the saplings into the ground
				with sharp thrusts, each time in exactly the same place, so that they went deeper
				and deeper. When she had completed a circle she stood up and deftly bent the fito
				over her head, twisting them together and twining smaller saplings across form- ing
				a lattice framework. Then she took the leaves we had collected and slit the stalks
				toward the end, like clothespins, hooking two or three of them together. When she
				had enough she started hanging them on the framework like tiles, overlapping each
				other and forming a waterproof covering. There were leaves left over when she had
				finished, so she let other women take them for their houses.<note type="scholarNote">4. Turnbull, pp.
					59-60.</note></quote>
			<p>The dwelling in the gathering culture is the focal point of women's creative activi¬
				ties. Since it is usually constructed from materials that can be replaced from
				available natural sources, it also binds society to its natural environment.</p>
			<p>
				<title>Desert Dwellings, Wigwams and Tipis</title> Semi-nomadic peoples live some
				part of the year in relatively permanent camps when an adequate food supply is
				available — wild plants, such as the wild rice of the Great Lakes region, or those
				provided by temporary cultivation. Some semi-nomadic peoples follow herds of wild
				or domestic animals part of the year and spend the rest gathering and hunting, or
				trading. These societies are not sedentary because they or their animals must range
				for some proportion of their food and the basics for making material goods. Gen¬
				erally they inhabit arid desert lands or plains choked with grasses, where farming
				is difficult.</p>
			<p>The architecture of such semi-nomads grew out of forms developed within gathering
				societies. Certain structural features of the grass house remained essential. For
				semi-nomadic desert dwellers, such as the Pima and Papago of the American Southwest, the convenient raw materials for building might still be plant fibers, particularly where the women were highly skilled basketweavers and had developed ways
				of weaving fibers into other forms, such as cotton cloth or yucca-fiber sandals.
				Up until the twentieth century the Pima were dispersed in the winter and set¬
				tlements were occupied only for a few months during a short growing season. The
				women built structures that mingled the style of mobile peoples with that of the
				ancient Southwest Pueblos. Their houses were grass but the interiors were slightly
				below ground. Sometimes earth was used to anchor the lower portion of the exterior
				wall, a feature which perhaps explains the evolution of the earth lodges built by
				the Navaho and by the Mandan further north.</p>
			<p>Another feature of grass houses is the tensile flexibility of the structure, which
				was later developed into the tent form. In the desert or plains it might be adjusted
				or even formed in relationship to wind patterns; the walls might be opened, or
				closed tightly, to adapt to the wide range of temperatures characteristic of these
				environments. The tent consists of a framework over which a tight covering is
				stretched; it may be low and rounded or tall and conical, but either shape, with its
				flexible covering, is perfectly adaptable. Tents also differ from grass houses in
				that the coverings, and sometimes the frames, are carried with the band as it moves.
				All the components of such tents, including those of the Tuareg, Algonkian wigwams
				and Plains tribes' tipis, are made by women — exterior and interior walls, floor
				coverings and frames. There is a traditional basic form, but the tent is by no
				means standardized. In each society wom-<pb n="37"/>en have created subtle
				variations on the frame or the arrangement of tent flaps for ventilation. In the
				arid Atlas Mountains of North Africa, Tuareg women weave and embroider wool
				coverings for their tents. The frame has a number of possible shapes, demonstrating
				the interplay between individual choice and cultural tradition.</p>
			<p> Algonkian-speaking groups, originally inhabiting much of the Eastern United States,
				were pushed west to the Great Lakes region after the white invasion. They hunted,
				gathered, fished, collected maple sugar, gathered wild rice, and had gardens. Some,
				like the Kickapoo, constructed wigwams of frames covered by mats. Others,
				including the Ojibwa, constructed conical tents covered with thin sheets of birch
				bark sewed together with small roots until long enough to cover the sides. Ojibwa
				women cut the poles for the frames and made colorful mats from reeds to cover the
				walls, and to serve as carpets, beds and sofas. Softening, bleaching and dyeing
				these reeds was a complicated process. The completed mats were carried from site to
				site. Early white observers were greatly impressed with the women's strength, as
				shown by this comment from 1855:</p>
			<quote>It may be easily supposed that these squaws, owing to their performing all the
				work of joiners, carpenters and masons have blistered hands. In fact, their hands
				are much harder to the touch than those of the men; and indeed their entire muscular
				system is far more developed and they are proportionately stronger in the
					arm.<note type="scholarNote">5. J.G. Kohl, Kitchi-Gami: Wandering Round Lake Superior (London,
					1860), p. 4.</note></quote>
			<p>Similarly, the tipi-builders of the Great Plains were responsible for all aspects of
				the construction of their dwellings. They developed one of the most striking forms
				in women's vernacular architecture. The Plains societies were mobile; they moved
				from winter hunting camps to large summer ceremonial villages and the women
				carried not only the skin coverings and interior liners, but the poles with which
				the tipi was erected as well. These were hard to find on the Plains, and made a
				useful sled (travois) for carrying household property and people over long
				distances.</p>
			<p>When more permanent materials were used for making dwellings, women often cooperated
				in their manufacture. In making an ordinary tipi, the owner scraped and tanned the
				hides from which the cover would be made, frequently using treasured tools which she
				had inherited from the women of her family. Then a female specialist was called in
				to cut and fit the skins, and neighbors gathered to but the traditional sacred
				designs and high standards of work are still rigorously adhered to.</p>
			<p>The Quillers' Society met when a woman of the community had vowed to undertake a
				project. An older woman held the society's medicine bundle, filled with objects of
				spiritual power, and with the vower, performed the rituals necessary for the work to
				begin and end. She would instruct the younger woman in needlework and the
				society's ceremonies; then the entire group started work together. Afterwards the
				woman who had vowed the task continued alone, although she could consult with
				society members whenever a problem arose.</p>
			<p>Men and children were not allowed to touch or see the work until it was completed,
				when members of the society displayed the piece to the public. Following a feast,
				the women whose work was on view became a member of the society, one of the most
				respected institutions of her world. Among the Cheyenne a woman's achievements in
				decorative craft were valued as highly as a man's deeds in war. Moreover, the
				Quillers' Society:</p>
			<quote>...was spoken of as being similar in help stitch them together with sinew. Making
				a tipi could also fulfill a sacred function. Plains women formed special
				associations, notably the Cheyenne Quillers' Society, for the ceremonial decoration of tipis and their interior walls with dyed porcupine or bird quills. More
				recently these tipis have been made from canvas and decorated with glass beads,
				conception and attitudes to the Sacred Arrows [most sacred Cheyenne men's
				society), one very important difference in behavior may be noted. During the
				four-day arrow ceremony no talking, joking, or laughing was allowed in camp. The
				making of the sacred beading was attended by a good deal of joking, teasing, and
				fun. While the cere- <pb n="38"/> monial character of the work was recognized, it
				interfered in no way with the social pleasure of the occasion.<note type="scholarNote">6. Alice
					Marriott, The Trade Guild of Southern Cheyenne Women," Bulletin of Okla- homa
					Anthropological Society (April 1956), p. 24.</note></quote>
			<p><title>Female Farmers</title> When societies obtain their food predominantly from
				horticulture, it is practical for the people to settle in more permanent
				villages close to their fields. Jobs are traditionally assigned to one sex or an
				other. Sometimes men and women cultivate different crops and even speak differ-
				ent languages.</p>
			<p>Even space within the village might alsco be divided along sex lines, and the architecture reflects and affects sex-specialized tasks. Women generally dominate culti-
				vation but building tasks are specified and divided according to sex. In much of
				Africa the characteristic building form is round, with a gabled and thatched roof
				and walls made of wattle and daub. Each component is made separately by men or
				women. Male and female tasks vary from society to society. Among the Kikuyu of
				Kenya, men construct the walls and women the roof. After the men finish their work,
				they go to the feast celebrating the house building. They goad the women, calling
				them "slow chameleons“ who will miss the feast if they don't hurry. The women, who
				are working on the thatching, typically respond in chorus:</p>
			<quote>You men, you lack the most important art in building, namely thatching. A
				wall and an empty roof cannot protect you from heavy rain nor from the burning sun.
				It is our careful thatching that makes the hut worth living. We are not chameleons
				but nyoni ya nyagathanga small songbirds known for their beautiful
					nests).<note type="scholarNote">7. Jomo Kenyatta, Facing Mount Kenya, Re- print of original 1938
					edition (New York: AMS Press, 1976), pp. 80-81.</note></quote>
			<p>Separation of the sexes does not necessarily serve as a foundation for male
				domination. Cultural practices that encourage one sex to feel communal soli¬
				darity and to express itself in opposition to the other seem to yield much autonomy
				to both men and women as groups, indicated by the development of separate eco¬
				nomic, social or ritual spheres outside of the activities that demand the involve¬
				ment of both sexes. The position of women is particularly strong in matrilineal
				societies, where they are leaders of clans and owners of the fields, of harvest,
				food storage and dwellings. The longhouse of the Iroquois-speaking tribes of North
				America, built until the mid-nineteenth century, was controlled by women, and was a
				remarkable example of communal living. The longhouse served as the center of
				Iroquois social life. Ritual performances took place there and it was both dwelling
				and workplace for the many families of the clan to whom it belonged. By controlling
				the longhouse and the food stores, women played a vital part in the political
				affairs of the tribes.<note type="scholarNote">8. Judith K. Brown, "Iroquois Women: An Ethnographic
					Note, in Toward an Anthropology of Women, pp. 235-251</note> Through
				manipulation of supplies they could encourage or prevent war parties. The senior
				women, who controlled the longhouse, also played an important role in social
				policy decisions. They appointed spokesmen for the clan in village and tribal
				councils, and they could also "remove the horns," that is, remove those spokesmen
				from office if they did not do their job according to the women's interests. The
				longhouse stood as a symbol of the society at large; the confederation of the
				Iroquois tribes recognized the significance of this woman-owned institution by
				naming themselves The League of the Longhouse.</p>
			<p>There are few matrilineal cultivating societies remaining in the world. One of their
				striking characteristics was that they were subsistence societies —that is, no
				wealth was accumulated from year to year. Although the source of food and the type
				of settlement differed, they shared this feature with the gathering peoples
				mentioned earlier. The change from subsistence society to one in which it is possible to accumulate wealth frequently comes with the addition of livestock or herd
				animals to horticultural life. Such a change in process was observed in the early
				nineteenth century among the Mandan, a cultivating society living on the North
				American Plains. Basically, the Mandan lived two life styles. The matrilineal one
				dominated the life of the vilage, where women were the farmers and owned and built
				the houses; the second was patrilineal, occurring during the sum- mer months, when
				some of the women tended the fields, while most of the men and a few women went into
				the Plains to hunt buffalo. This resulted in an important division of economic
				tasks and calendars —the women living by an older agricultural calendar, and the
				men by the seasonal migration of the buffalo herds.</p>
			<p>In the Mandan village, the lodges the women constructed were admirably suited to the
				climate of the Great Plains. They may have originated as structures like those of
				the Pima. Walls of willow saplings and brush and a final layer of earth were erected
				over a wooden frame. The walls were built quite thick and the lodges were cool in
				summer and warm in winter. Quite possibly these were the prototypes for the sod
				houses built by pioneers settling in the Plains in the nineteenth century. </p>
			<pb n="39"/>
			<p> If the Mandan had survived the epidemic of smallpox which destroyed the tribe in
				1840, it is possible that they would have become patrilineal, giving up cultivation altogether to pursue the buffalo as other Plains tribes did. In patrilineal
				societies, as we have seen with the Cheyenne, the woman's position is secure when
				she continues to control important cultural or economic features. Frequently these
				two spheres are connected, as in societies where women have a specialized architec¬
				ture for their own activities. The Igbo society in Nigeria is patrilineal, but with
				the exception of the yam, all produce is considered women's property; they sell
				anything left over from feeding their families, becoming successful traders. A
				century ago when this marketing activity was increasing, the women also began to
				construct ritual sanctuaries in groves outside the villages. Called mbayo houses,
				these were maintained by a cult of the earth goddess Ala, and were decorated with
				male and female symbols and erotic figures.</p>
			<p>In patrilineal societies women may have certain economic powers; if so, they usually
				own their own houses within the compounds of their husbands' families. But when men
				control agriculture and herding, or have access to a modern cash market, the
				domicile and all public buildings fall totally under male control. Men erect the
				structures; if they are dwellings, women may decorate the walls. In Mediterranean
				villages in Spain, Greece and the Balkans, and in Islamic villages of the Near East
				and Africa, woman is associated with the domicile as its caretaker, not as its
				owner. The isolation of women in the home is, of course, a function of wealth. In
				poorer cultures the woman may be forced to work for the family's survival, but in
				most places, she is supposed to remain in the home. In Spain, she decorates her
				house with whitewash as a symbol of purity —both of the domicile and of its
				keeper. When a woman's life is relegated to the private sphere of society, her
				significance in the culture appears merely symbolic. She is a possession to be
				protected. In Berber villages, she weaves inside her husband's house; the loom is
				not considered her tool, but a symbol of male protection. Sitting behind it, she is
				shielded from the door and from the street life that lies beyond it.<note type="scholarNote">9. Pierre
					Bourdieu, "The Berber House, or the World Reversed," excerpted in Rules and
					Meanings, ed. Mary Douglas (Baltimore: Penguin, 1973), p. 100.</note> Thus women
				are isolated from the world of confrontation, conversation and public
				interaction.</p>
			<p>With the advent of industrialism and the wage economy in any society, separation of
				home life from public work becomes firmly entrenched. The many roles of women are
				reduced to motherhood and housekeeping. The number of craftswomen, artists,
				businesswomen and builders decrease. Separation of home from business premises
				makes it more difficult for women to share in a work world dominated by men.
